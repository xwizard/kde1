The KDE addressbook
================================================================================
If you want kab to be extended, please send a mail to me. Also 
contact me if you want to comment some of the features mentioned 
below. Send the mail to mirko@kde.org
Thanks.
PS: I am still looking for volunteers who try writing the import filters. 
    Most often I do not have the different other addressbook programs myselfes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
° [done] change mail addresses to an unlimited list with selection before
         sending an email
° [currently not planned] allow user to add custom fields
° [partly implemented] a searchable keyword field
° automatic menus for kmail and ktalk
° [done for HTML] add export methods
° add import methods:
  - Netscape messenger
  - Microsoft outlook
  - bbdb
  - Pine
  - Corel 8 - Suite address book 
  - Time & Chaos
  - what else?
° enhance the telephone numbers section, using home/work/..., 
  fixed/mobile, and so on
° better dialog to enter the birthday, especially directly
° some functions in the main display, like clickable parts 
  (email/talk addresses, possibly telephony support?),
  possibly using KURLLabel
° configurable sorting order (already prepared)
° create and add Max Berger's Qoutlook importer tool
° add telephony support where the telephone number is automatically dialed
  using the modem, the user can pick up his telephone after the connection 
  is created
  HELP WANTED: Does anybody know how to do that?
° send mail to a bunch of people at once using the keywords and the search 
  functionality. 
° IMPORTANT: Possibility to use different files and, most important, common 
  addressbooks for different people.
