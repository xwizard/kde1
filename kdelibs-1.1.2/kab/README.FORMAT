The KDE addressbook
===================

The format that kab uses is plain ASCII, written by an ConfigDB object.
The doc- umentation for ConfigDB can be found on my homepage.  In general,
it provides an easy way to read and write hierarchical structured files
storing data of basic C++ data types. The files may be edited manually if
the syntax is not violated. An addressbook database file contains two
sections, one to store the users ent- ries, called "entries", and one to
store the configuration, called "config". Every subsection of the
"entries" section is one entry, containing a key-value- pair for every
data item.  For example, my entry for the KDE mailing lists looks like
this:

  [20]
    # key-value-pairs
    URL="http://www.kde.org/"
    additionalName=""
    address=""
    birthday=""
    comment=""
    deliveryLabel=""
    email=""
    email2=""
    email3=""
    emails="kde-devel@fiwi02.wiwi.uni-tuebingen.de\ekde@lists.netcentral.net\e"
    fax=""
    firstname=""
    fn="KDE Mailing-Listen"
    keywords=""
    modem=""
    name=""
    namePrefix=""
    org=""
    orgSubUnit=""
    orgUnit=""
    role=""
    talk=""
    telephone=""
    title=""
    town=""
  [END 20]

Note that "emails" is a list of strings, delimited by "\e".  If you plan
to read kab files, you probably should use the kab API, so you do not need
to parse the file format yourselfes (read README.KABAPI).
