<H1> KSpell - KDE Spelling Checker </H1>
<P>By David Sweet</P>

<H2>Configuration Dialog</H2>
<P>
You can choose the dictionary to use for spell checking from the list of
installed dictionaries.
</P>
<P>
If you choose <EM>Latin1</EM> as your <EM>Encoding</EM>, then accented
(or otherwise decorated characters) are recognized by KSpell.  If you choose
<EM>7-Bit/ASCII</EM>, then it is assumed that decorated characters
were entered into your document as two-character combinations.  For
example (in Spanish), in the word "espa'nol", the "'n" character
combination is treated as an "n" with a tilde over it.
</P>

<P>
It is recommend that you do not change the first two options unless you have read the Interational ISpell man page.
