ensure that KSpell is reusable with the same replace/ignore lists
 for multiple spellchecks in a single editing session

allow saving of ignore/replace lists for multiple spellchecks of a
  given document across multiple sessions

properly handle capitalization on "Replace All" (in parseOneResponse())



Done
^^^^
change all constant strings to klocale->translate(string);  (or i18n?)

set the dialog box's icon to that of the parent


add a "move()" function to move the dialog box (calling app should use this
	in response to a mispelled() signal to move the d.b.  out of the way
	of the misspelled word)
 This is done, but it doesn't work on the first call -- any ideas?
