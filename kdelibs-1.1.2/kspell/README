KSpell v0.3.2, 4/5/98
By David Sweet


KSpell provides an interface to International ISpell 3.1.  You should use
it like a UI widget to provide spellchecking in your application.  See
kspell.h and http://www.chaos.umd.edu/~dsweet/KDE/KSpell for
documentation.  You may also be interested in the ISpell Language-Pack.
It contains ISpell dictionaries for German, Spanish, and Brazilian
Portugues.  It is available for download at 
	http://www.chaos.umd.edu/~dsweet/KDE/KSpell.

A configuration dialog/widget is also provided.  This class (KSpellConfig) acts
not only as a widget allowing the user to set KSpell preferences, but also
as a data abstraction class allowing you to get and set the preferences from
within your program.  You can pass an instance of KSpellConfig to KSpell
and the spellchecker will run with the appropriate preference settings.  The
preferences, when saved (see kspelldlg.h) are saved globally.  If needed,
you can read them with KSpellDlg and set and use application-specific
spellchecking settings.

Thank you.
