This directory contains the stuff necesary to build a BSD package out of
kdelibs.  Remember to make NO_CHECKSUM=yes, otherwise it won't build.

To get this to work correctly:

Copy or symlink Makefile.port to Makefile*, and run make, followed by make
install and/or make package (If you want a package of this around).  It
should build automagically.

I have purposely not named this Makefile, because it could easily confuse
the autoconf stuff.
