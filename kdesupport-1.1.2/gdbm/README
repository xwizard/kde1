GNU dbm is a set of database routines that use extendible hashing and
works similar to the standard UNIX dbm routines.

This is release 1.7.3 of GNU dbm.

To compile gdbm:

   a)  configure <config parameters like -prefix ... see INSTALL>
   b)  make 

To compile the optional test and conversion programs:

   a)  make progs

To install the basic package:

   a)  make install

To install the optional dbm and ndbm compatibility headers:

   a)  make install-compat

(You might want to "make -n install" to make sure it will put things
were you want them.)

Future versions of GDBM may be far, far more UNIX dependent than the
library is, currently.  If you are/have ported GDBM to non-UNIX like
operating systems, please send e-mail to <downsj@csos.orst.edu>.
Please include information about your port, including the type of
operating system, your reasons for doing the port, and what changes
you have made.
