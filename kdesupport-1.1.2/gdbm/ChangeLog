	  testgdbm.c, update.c, gdbm.h: Added code to allow for a
	  GDBM_FAST mode in which fsync is not called during
	  database update mode. Added a new flag "-f" to 
	  testgdbm to make use of the new fast mode.

	* gdbmsync.c: Added this function to allow a programmer
	  to use the GDBM_FAST mode but still be able to sync
	  a database.

	  sure the file is written to disk before continuing.

Sun Mar 21 21:33:31 1993  Phil Nelson  (phil at cs.wwu.edu)

	* proto.h: Added this as a new file.  It adds ANSI prototypes
	  for ANSI compilers.

	* gdbmreorg.c: Added an "end update" on the new database and
	  correctly set up the bucket cache.

	* update.c: (_gdbm_end_update) Added type void to header.

Wed Mar 17 19:14:27 1993  Phil Nelson  (phil at cs.wwu.edu)

Thu Feb 28 17:05:09 1991  Phil Nelson  (phil at strawberry.cs.wwu.edu)

	* Added 1991 to copyright lines on all files.

	* gdbmfetch.c: Fixed a bug introduced by previous changes.

	* version.c:  Updated version to 1.5.

Fri Feb  8 12:27:13 1991  Phil Nelson  (phil at strawberry.cs.wwu.edu)

	* Change author's e-mail address in all comments.

	* gdbmopen.c, systems.h: Changed opening sequence so that a
	  database will not be truncated in NEWDB mode until the
	  write has locked the file.

	* testgdbm.c: Fixed a bug that caused a segmentation fault on
	  one computer.  Also added the flags "-r" for opening the
	  database as a READER and "-n" for opening the database as
	  a NEWDB writer.  The default mode remains the WRCREAT mode.

	* Various source files, changed the data types of various
	  variables from int to long.  This should not make any difference
	  to systems where sizeof(int) = sizeof(long).  It should make
	  it easier to move to other systems.

	* gdbmstore.c: Added a check for NULL key or content dptr.  Due to
	  NULLs being used as error indications, data cannot be NULL also.

	* gdbmfetch.c, gdbmseq.c, fetch.c: Added checks for zero sized
	  key and content so malloc will not try to allocate zero bytes.

        * gdbmconst.h: Added this file so that all constants are in one
	  central place.  A few constants can be changed without changing
	  the header sizes.

Tue Aug 14 13:08:43 1990  Phil Nelson  (phil at unicorn.wwu.edu)

	  more completely.

	* dbm.h: Added a null define to satisfy some versions that
	  require a dbmclose() call.

	  pointer in ...ca_data.dptr.

	* gdbmdelete.c: Added code to more completely remove the
	  cache entry for a deleted item.

	* gdbmreorg.c: Added code to finish the transfer of information
	  from the new_dbf to the orginal dbf.

Fri May 30 08:29:16 1990  Phil Nelson  (phil at unicorn.wwu.edu)

	* gdbmstore.c: Changed a strncpy to bcopy.

Tue May 15 09:55:21 1990  Phil Nelson  (phil at unicorn.wwu.edu)

	* Version 1.3 released.

	* systems.h: Changed the defines for alloca to use the

	  GNUC and for sun sparc.

Fri May 11 12:15:56 1990  Phil Nelson  (phil at unicorn.wwu.edu)

	* systems.h: Removed the include for <sys/types> and now
	  systems.h requires <sys/types> included before it.

	  and alldbm in the all option.

	  to make the code more readable.

	* update.c (_gdbm_fatal): Changed fatal message from "dbm fatal:"

	* Version 1.2 released.

Fri Apr 27 09:49:59 1990  Phil Nelson  (phil at unicorn.wwu.edu)

	* Makefile: Added the dist option.  Similar to the 
	  addition from hack@ai.mit.edu, but correct.

	* falloc.c (push_avail_block):  Change the avail count
	  to reflect the correct number of entries.

	* dbminit.c (dbminit): Changed the stat call to stat the
	  ".dir" file as is done in dbmopen.c (dbm_open).

Tue Apr 10 12:18:40 1990  Phil Nelson  (phil at unicorn.wwu.edu)

	* Version 1.1. released.
