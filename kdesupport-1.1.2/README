Direct any bug reports in the Makefiles and the configure script to me. 
Please note, that the code in this package is not written by the KDE
Team, so you should report bugs in the code of this package to the
authors themself. For this purpose I made a list of contact addresses:

gdbm:
  The author of GNU dbm may be reached via e-mail to <phil@cs.wwu.edu>,
  and the current maintainer may be reached at <downsj@csos.orst.edu>.
  E-mail may be sent to either, or both, of these people.

giflib: (note, that we use the little outofdate version 2.3)
  This package was originally written by Gershon Elber <gershon@cs.utah.edu>
  in 1990 on an IBM PC under MS-DOS using Borland Turbo C.  He made it portable
  to several UNIX environments.  This 2.1 version features substantial changes
  and additions by Eric S. Raymond <esr@snark.thyrsus.com>.

  Please send bug reports, offers of help, etc. to jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.
