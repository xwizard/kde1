This is my QwSpriteField class set for implementing efficiently redrawn
sprites in the Qt GUI Toolkit.  

This directory contains all the sources for the QwSpriteField class set.

The documentation is in html/index.html

A trivial example is given in example.cpp

The sprite subdirectory is graphics for the example program.  It is
pregenerated, but if you have POVRAY 3.0 you can experiment with that
too.  

This software is licensed under the LGPL.  In essence, this means that
you can use it in any application, but if you modify it, you must
distribute your modifications in source form along with your software
(or preferrably, talk with me about getting your changes into the
standard distribution).  If you do not modify it, it is sufficient to
give a clearly visible reference (a URL will do) to the source code. 
Full details are described in COPYING.LIB
