It should be reasonably easy to get kmidi to work on any platform
with sound support. 

o Check linux_a.c, dec_a.c, sun_a.c etc for pointers as to how to write
  a new yourplatform_a.c file.
  
o Do a grep for AU_LINUX and see where any of those special defines
  would make sense for your platform.
