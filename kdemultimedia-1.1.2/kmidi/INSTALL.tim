	INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

	You need at least the source distribution ("timidity-0.2i.tar.gz"
or later).  If you don't have any GUS-compatible patches or MIDI files,
you should also get "timidity-lib-0.2.tar.gz", which contains Dustin
McCartney's excellent acoustic piano and nylon guitar patches, and some
sample MIDI files.  If you already have "timidity-lib-0.1.tar.gz" from an
earlier installation, it's the exact same thing except for a few words in
the README file.  Unpack the library archive under the directory
"timidity-0.2i".  Now cd into "timidity-0.2i" and follow the four easy
steps:

	The archives are also available as "timid02i.zip" and
"tilib02.zip".  A 32-bit Windows executable is available in
"tim3202i.zip" in case you don't want to build it from scratch.

Compiling (UNIX):

(1)	Check the options in the Makefile:

	    a: select the audio driver by uncommenting one of the
               following:
			* Linux/FreeBSD audio driver	  
	    		* HP-UX network audio server
			* Sun audio driver
			* DEC MME driver

	    b: select the kind of interface you want:
			* ncurses full-screen interface
			* S-Lang full-screen interface
			* X-MOTIF interface
			* Tcl/Tk interface

	    You can select more than one interface and then use the -i
	    option to pick one at runtime.  If you can compile a
	    statically linked Motif binary for Linux, please email me!

	    If your make won't +=, edit the Makefile as if it did, and
	    then type "./my make right or wrong" in the distribution
	    directory.

	and say:

		make

	If TiMidity won't compile, check paths to headers and libraries,
	edit the Makefile appropriately, and try again.  Note that you'll
	need ncurses to build the ncurses interface.  Also check config.h.
	Email me if you need to make nontrivial adjustments to get it to
	work.


Compiling (Windows):

(1)	Use Borland C++ 4.51 to compile TiMidity.  In case of trouble,
	please email Davide Moretti <dmoretti@iper.net> or use the
	prebuilt executable.


Testing:

(2)	Adjust audio volume to a comfortable level and say:

	Linux/FreeBSD:

		./timidity -OdM -s22 midi/impromptu.mid

	HP-UX (you need to be running the HP network audio server):

		./timidity -OdM -s16 -o `hostname` midi/impromptu.mid

	SunOS:

		./timidity -OdM -s22050 midi/impromptu.mid

	Windows:

		timidity -OdM -s22050 midi/impromptu.mid

	System without audio driver (a 2,335,998-byte, 8-kHz uLaw file
	"output.au" will be generated):

		./timidity -OrMU -s8 -o output.au midi/impromptu.mid

	You should get a rendition of Chopin's Fantasie Impromptu.  
	If not, and you're running Linux, try making noise with some
	other software to make sure your sound hardware is working
	properly. On systems other than Linux, you may need to fiddle
	with the options.  Let me know what works.

	If you get choppy sound, make sure TiMidity is getting enough CPU
	time. You can try using a lower sampling rate (the -s option).


Installing:

(3)	When you've got a working executable, you can check the target
	directories in the Makefile, become root if necessary, and say:

		make install.all

	to install the executable, the manual page, and the support files
	(patches and MIDI examples) in the directories specified. If you
	don't wish to install the support files, you can say:

		make install.bin install.man

	to install just the executable and the manual page.


Using:

(4)	Now you can play around with the options to get the best sound
	quality. 

		timidity -h

	will get you a brief list. More detailed information is available
	in the manual page. Also, check out the FAQ for pointers to more 
	instruments and MIDI files.
