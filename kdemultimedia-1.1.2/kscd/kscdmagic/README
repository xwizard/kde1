SYNAESTHESIA v1.3

Introduction
============

This is a program for representing sounds visually (from a CD or line
input). It goes beyond the usual oscilliscope style program by combining
an FFT and stereo positioning information to give a two dimensional
display. Some of the shapes I have observed are:
  * Drums: clouds of color, fairly high
  * Clean guitar: several horizontal lines, low down
  * Rough guitar: a cloud, low down
  * Trumpet: Lots of horizontal lines everywhere
  * Flute: A single horizontal line, low down
  * Voice: A vertical line with some internal structure

Surround sound decoding has been added in version 1.1. Ambient noise is
shown in orange.

X-Windows support has been added in version 1.3, as well as a major redesign
of the interface. The intention is to make Synaesthesia a fully functional
CD player, suitable for use while working.

Usage
=====

Compile Synaesthesia by typing "make".

You will need to run Synaesthesia as root. Xsynaesthesia can be run
by any user providing you provide permissions on /dev/dsp, /dev/cdrom,
and /dev/mixer.

Synaesthesia creates a configuration file you can edit, named
~/.synaesthesia.  You can edit this to set the default brightness,
volume and X-Window position.

Run Synaesthesia or Xsynaesthesia with no parameters for further
information on how to use it.

Authors
=======

This program is free. If you like it, or have any suggestions, please
send me (Paul Harrison) an email (pfh@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au).

Thanks to Asger Alstrup Nielsen (alstrup@diku.dk) for many great 
suggestions, and for writing optimized 32 bit loops for fading and drawing
to screen. 

Known Bugs
==========

Under 2.0.x kernels, the sound device prints "Sound: Recording overrun" in
an annoying fashion.

Changes
=======

1.1 - Added surround sound decoding.
1.2 - Fixed a bug in the ioctl calls to /dev/dsp.
1.3 - Asger Alstrup Nielsen's optimizations added.
      Added X-Windows support.
      More options, redesigned interface.
