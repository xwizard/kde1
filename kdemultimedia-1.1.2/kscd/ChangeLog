1999-04-13  Harri Porten  <porten@kde.org>

	* converted some C++ comments in C file files
	* incorporated patches from Dag Nygren <dag@newtech.fi>:
	* plat_scor5.c: support for SCO Openserver 5.0 
	* cdrom.c: added SONY CDU-76S

1999-03-17  Harri Porten  <porten@kde.org>

	* kscd.cpp: applied patch from Petter Reinholdtsen <pere@hungry.com>
	(bug#302) that prevents a segfault if cddb directory is invalid.
	* CDDialog.cpp: fixed length of last title (bug#304).

1999-02-18  Harri Porten  <porten@kde.org>

	* cddb.cpp: work around snprintf() for non-GNUish systems
	* cdrom.c, cdinfo.c, plat_linux.c: removed forward declaration of
	strchr(). It broke compilation with recent glibc and wasn't used
	anyway (bug #666 and #671). 

1998-12-22  Sam Maloney <thufir@illogic.ml.org>

	* Added to last commit, as so the 'autodock' checkbox would be
	disabled when 'docking' was unchecked, and vice versa.

1998-12-20  Sam Maloney <thufir@illogic.ml.org>

	* Just simple bugfixes to make more stable like...:
	* Fixed so that when one turns on or off 'enable docking' it
	adds/removes the dockwidget in the panel (instead of before one
	would have to restart kscd).
	* Fixed so that if one turned off 'enable docking' but still had
	'autodock enabled' on, then it would NOT dock (and remove the
	widget).

1998-12-12  Christian Esken  <esken@kde.org>

	* Tweaked docking a bit more. Under certain circumstances,
	dock_widget->dock() correctly does not get called at the start
	of the program. So if you docked, the window just vanished.	
	I added a call to dock_widget->dock()  at "appropiate" places.

1998-11-28  Bernd Wuebben  <wuebben@petit.cornell.edu>

	* kscd.cpp: resinstated old look and behavior
	Sam, we should talk ...

1998-11-20 Sam Maloney <thufir@illogic.ml.org>

	* Fixed bug/"missing thing" were it would just crash when loading
	  up if it couldn't find the cddb base dir. Now it will use
	  InexactDialog to prompt the user for the directory. (cancel button
	  will force it to get from remote). 
	* NOTE: Im just going fix the inexact dialog box so it can be
	  single line input, (for the cddb dialog), then ill probably
	  release 1.2.4, unless anyone has any objections. (to lazy to fix
	  tonite)

1998-11-11 Sam Maloney <thufir@illogic.ml.org>

	* Fixed bug with debug flag being messed up when docking
	  (incorrect extern statement)
	* Worked around a wierd bug thing with docking. (consult
	  docking.cpp in toggleState() )

1998-11-08 Robert Bossecker <Robert.Bossecker@fresenius.de>

	* Fixed problem with editing EXT info, where if you edited track
	  x, it would (stupidly) modify x-1. If editing track 1, it would
	  modify the extinfo for the Title.

1998-11-06 Sam Maloney <thufir@illogic.ml.org>

	* Made smtpMailer a global widget, so it could mail in background. 
	* Fixed problem were after submitting a record via SMTP, and
	  having an error, if one tried to exit Kscd, it would close all
	  widgets, but be stuck in while loop.
	* Added error/success reporting of SMTP submissions.
	* Fixed problem with Local Cache, where it would ignore leading
	  0's in record file names, thus not finding them when looking for 
	  that record.
	* Added a timeout when waiting for server interaction.

1998-11-04  Sam Maloney  <thufir@illogic.ml.org>

	* Fixed problem with 'dock' button, when AutoDock is turned on.
	* Implimented SMTP code, so Kscd no longer requires sendmail/unix
	  mail program(s) to submit CDDB records.
	* Added VERY requested feature, of having it retract the tray if
	  its ejected, when one hits the eject button.

1998-10-14 Alexei Dets   <dets@services.ru>

       * Fixed CD Database Editor close handling.

1998-10-13  Sam Maloney  <thufir@illogic.ml.org>

	* Added "play on tray close" feature
	* Many little fixes
	
1998-09-23  Sam Maloney  <thufir@illogic.ml.org>
	
	* Fixed submission of CDDB records, where it would not include a
	  'PLAYORDER=' at the bottom of the email.
	* Switched it over from using 'mail -s <subject> < record', to
	  using sendmail. (currently adding SMTP suppport, so it uses
	  no external program for this)

1998-09-21  Sam Maloney  <thufir@illogic.ml.org>
	
	* Added automatic storing of CDDB records downloaded from CDDB
	  server to local harddrive.
	* Fixed bug with routine connecting signals, over and over again,
	  causing routines to be called too many time, annoying CDDB
	  server admins. Happens when a new CDDB (remote) request was
	  issued.
	* Added snazyness of having the pulldown track selection box
	  display ("%02d: %s", tracknumber, trackname) for each item,
	  instead of just the number. 

Fri May 15 18:28:40 1998  Bernd Johannes Wuebben  <wuebben@math.cornell.edu>

	* docking.cpp: fixed up the docking behaviour

	* Some Layout improvements. -- still not 100% satisfied with the
