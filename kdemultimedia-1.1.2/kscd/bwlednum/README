This is a very very primitive LED. It was designed to work with my
kaudiosuite ( kplayer, kmodplayer kcdplayer etc..) It may or may not
be sufficient for your purposes. The main problem in designing
it was to get the pixels on the segments right, which turned out to 
be difficult. As a consequence there are only very few sizes at
which BW_LED_Number displays nicely out of the box. If you want it to
work at a particular size you might need to invest some work in:

void BW_LED_Number::drawSegment()                 

Send me patches if you are able to improve on it. :-) 

Have fun,
