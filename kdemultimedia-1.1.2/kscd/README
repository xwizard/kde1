KSCD 1.2.0t1
============

	* Fixed CDDB code big time.
	* Submissions now fixed.
	* Server requests fixed.
	* Local storing of CDDB records. (automatic)

KSCD have been broken and NOT updated, since the release of KDE 1.0, and
that is a long time ago, so i decided to fix MAJOR problems with the CDDB
code, now it is permitted to use and upload to the CDDB database.

	* KSCD 0.8
	* CDDB submissions enabled.


Remember if kscd seems to have trouble with your cd drive, do a 'make clean'
then 'make' and answer the questions posed by the kscd-script to configure
kscd suitable for your cdrom drive.
