   This release contains preliminary support for OSF/1. There are still
   problems and unsupported features, but the idea is that putting out
   this buggy version will motivate someone to fix what's wrong. I don't
   have any OSF/1 boxes so I can't look at it myself.
   
   If you use something other than the provided Makefile.osf1, note that
   you must define the "OSF1" macro in your cc options or the OSF/1
   platform module won't compile.
   
   Excerpted from a mail message from R.J. Edwards, who did the port:
   
     I was able to port workman to a DEC alpha OSF/1 v1.2 machine today.
     I had trouble with imake/xmkmf. In the Makefile I had to change
     INCDIR and LIBDIR to point to my xview directories.
     
     I still have to specify my drive name with the -c option and it
     will bomb out if there's no cd in it. The volume controls don't
     work and I can't eject w/o terminating workman and doing it
     manually. These problems are probably due to using the ultrix
     platform and not doing the work necessary for the OSF/1 platform.

   If you're an OSF/1 guru and would like to address the above problems,
   or any others you find, please [3]let me know.
