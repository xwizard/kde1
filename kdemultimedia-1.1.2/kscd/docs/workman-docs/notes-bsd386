   WorkMan was ported to BSD/386 by John Kohl ([1]jtk@kolvir.blrc.ma.us).
   
   To compile and run WorkMan on BSD/386, you will need two things not
   provided in the BSD/386 release:
    1. XView libraries and include files (3.0 or later), available on
       [2]bsdi.com for anonymous FTP.
    2. [3]Diffs for the CDROM library (to provide a volume function with
       better resolution.) These are in the file patch-bsd386 in the
       WorkMan source's html directory.
       
   If you have a SoundBlaster Pro with a driver installed (also available
   from bsdi.com, the SBlast-1.5 version, not Steve McCanne's version),
   you can compile SoundBlaster volume control code, which is useful for
   non-SCSI CDROM devices. To do so, edit the Imakefile to remove the
   comments around LOCALDEFS. Once you have compiled, you can enable the
   SoundBlaster volume control by patching the sb_fd variable to -1, like
   so:
   
     % /usr/bin/gdb -w workman
     (gdb) set sb_fd = -1
     (gdb) quit
     %
     
   Use imake to generate a BSD/386 Makefile, with something like:
   
     imake -DUseInstalled -I/usr/src/local/XView3.0/config
     -I/usr/X11/lib/X11/config
     
   For SCSI CD-ROM drives, WorkMan must be run as root (perhaps as
   setuid, but that may have security implications on database file
   reading) in order to have access to issue SCSI audio commands.
