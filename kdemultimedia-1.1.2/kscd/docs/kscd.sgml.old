Kscd is part of the kdemultimedia package available at 
KDE project <url url="http://www.kde.org">.

<p>
In order to successfully compile Kscd, you need the latest versions of the KDE libraries as well as the Qt C++ library.All required libraries as well as Kscd 
itself can be found on <url url="ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/kde/">.

directory of the Kscd distribution:

</verb></tscreen>

<p>
Please inform me of any modification you had to undertake in order to
get KSCD to compile on your platform.
<p>
<sect>Onscreen Fundamentals
<p>

I am sure however that you will have no trouble operating KSCD, otherwise,
write up what was difficult to understand and I will include it here..

<sect>CDDB Support<p>
Kscd by default installs its cddb database files in 
<tt>KDEIDR/share/apps/kscd/cddb</tt>. You can create as many category subdirectories
as you like. However, when uploading only the
offical cddb categories are displayed. The default upload address is
<tt>xmcd-cddb@amb.org</tt>. For more information about CDDB visit the
CDDB <htmlurl url="http://www.cddb.com" name="homepage">.

<p>
<sect>Questions and answers
If you experience trouble in particular with the cddb functionality try the
start kscd as <tt>kscd -d</tt> and observer the debug output.
<p>

<sect>Thanks<p>

the CDDB database concept. Visit <htmlurl url="http://www.cddb.com" name="www.cddb.com">
