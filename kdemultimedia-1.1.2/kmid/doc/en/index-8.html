<LI><CODE>Q:</CODE> What is exactly a midi file ?<BR>
<CODE>A:</CODE>A Midi file is a file that contains the information on how to play a song, that is, it contains simply the notes, the rhythm, velocity, etc.
This implies that the same midi file, when played in two different devices, can produce very different results, as well as a given staff can be played very differenly by two different musicians.

<LI><CODE>Q:</CODE>I can get better sound with a mp3/wav player, why should I use KMid?<BR>
<CODE>A:</CODE>Well, I cannot force anyone to use KMid, but a typical midi file occupies 50 Kb. while a typical mp3 file occupies 4 Mb. (and that is a 1:80 compression ratio :-) . And with a good synthesizer device, you can get a comparable sound quality. Evenmore, with a midi file, you can change individual instruments, change the velocity of a song, etc. so you have more overall control.

<LI><CODE>Q:</CODE>I can't get my AWE card to work with KMid, what can I do ?<BR>
<CODE>A:</CODE>This can happen when you get a binary distribution (rpm, deb) of KMid. It happens because KMid was compiled without awe support. If it doesn't
work, then you must download a source code distribution (for example, from

</LI>
<LI><CODE>Q:</CODE>I want to add a whole directory to a collection, but having to add the midi files one by one is not funny.<BR>
<CODE>A:</CODE>I agree, that's why KMid supports Drag&amp;Drop. Just open, in KFM, the directory you want to add, select all the files, drag them and drop them in KMid.<BR>
Be sure to set the <CODE>AutoAdd</CODE> option before, so that the files will be added to the current collection. If you don't do this, files will be added to the Temporary Collection.

</LI>
<LI><CODE>Q:</CODE>I can't follow the lyrics, it's playing too fast !<BR>
<CODE>A:</CODE>You can press the left arrow of the tempo LCD to make it play slower. Remember that you can do a double click on the LCD to get the default tempo.</LI>
