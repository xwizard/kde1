<H3><A NAME="ss9.1">9.1 Some tips and tricks</A>
</H3>

<P>
<P>I will include some tips so that you can take fully advantage from all the features of KMid :
<P>
<UL>
<LI><CODE>Opening files</CODE><BR>
I always keep a KDE desktop with a KFM window in my root midi directory, and KMid in this desktop (if playing a midi file) or sticky (if playing a karaoke file :-)). This way, when the active collection finishes, or I want to play some file, I just go to the KFM window, select the desired files and make Drag&amp;Drop to the KMid's window.
<P>Suppose that you want to play some midi files, but don't want to add
them to any collection, well, just turn off the <CODE>AutoAdd to Collection</CODE> option in the <CODE>Collections</CODE> menu, and open the files, they will be added to the
Temporary Collection .
<P>
</LI>
<LI><CODE>Another method to create a new Collection</CODE><BR>
Suppose that you have midi files A.mid , B.mid and C.mid . At first you
only want to play the first midi file, so you unselect <CODE>AutoAdd</CODE> and open
A.mid . You get then a Temporary Collection with only one midi file .
<P>Then you decide to play also B and C, and make a collection with all them,
what do you do ?
<P>Easy, select <CODE>AutoAdd</CODE> and open B.mid and C.mid (by any of the multiple
methods), they will be automatically added to the Temporary Collection, that
will then have A.mid, B.mid and C.mid . At this point, you can open the
<CODE>Organize Collections</CODE> dialog, select the Temporary Collection, and click on the <CODE>Copy</CODE> button, enter the name of the new collection, and you are done .  You already have a new collection, which holds the A,B and C midi files, and that is not deleted when you close KMid.

</H3>

<P>KMid has been made by Antonio Larrosa Jim&eacute;nez, in M&aacute;laga (Spain) .
I am a student of Mathematics at the University of M&aacute;laga, currently
I'm doing the third course, so I don't have much free time for my hobbies, but I always try to get some :-) . My hobbies include : Programming, collecting midi files, playing music and proving theorems ;-) .
<P>If you want to know where to download midi/karaoke files, you have any question, a bug to report, an idea or a feature you'd like to see in KMid or just want
to make me happy, feel free to send me an email to : 
<A HREF="mailto:larrosa@kde.org">larrosa@kde.org</A> or 
<A HREF="mailto:antlarr@arrakis.es">antlarr@arrakis.es</A><P>or write to me by snail-mail at :

<P>You will really make me happy if you send me a postcard from where you live, or a midi/karaoke file from a local music group of your country . Everyone
who sends me a postcard or a midi file will have his/her name in the Hall of
KMid's friends of this file (provided they don't oppose to this) . Please
contact me before sending me any midi files because I may have it already .
<P>I'd like to stress that KMid has been done completely on free time, without any monetary support from any company nor particular. So plese keep in mind when you use it, that the only think that keep me working on this is getting some feedback from its users (a postcard, or just an email).
