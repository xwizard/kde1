This version fix a bug that made kmid totally unusable to many users

1.7     2-4-99
-----  -------
Modified KMid to work with Linux kernels from the 2.2.x series which
work very different than the ones in 2.0.x . That problem made KMid
continue playing music for a while (up to a few minutes !) after the
user had pressed the stop button.
Fixed a problem with AWE cards that made it play files with the pitch
bender raised.
Fixed a problem that made kmid not to play the last few milliseconds of
some songs (sometimes up to half a second)
Another usual fixes (better support for kernel modules, workarounds for
compiler bugs, etc.)
