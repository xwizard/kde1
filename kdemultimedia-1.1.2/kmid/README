If you are looking for a KMid README file, then this is NOT the one you are
looking for. Please look the online documentation, that is, the html help 

I've left this file only for help on the small cousin of KMid, ConsoleKMid.

1. What is ConsoleKMid ?
------------------------
   ConsoleKMid is a small program for Unix in console mode, which uses the same
   player engine of KMid. Of course it doesn't have the same friendly
   interface of KMid but it works to play midi files.

   If you have the rpm distribution, you will not find the consolekmid program
   unless you have compiled it from the src.rpm distribution
   

2. Requirements of consoleKMid
-------------------------------

   A UNIX machine, a soundcard and a /dev/sequencer device well installed. 
   If you have a GUS, you need a properly installed driver from the Linux 
   Ultrasound Project, AWE cards are also supported, but you will probably
   need to compile consoleKMid in order to get an AWE card to work.
   FM devices are also supported. 
   I have only tested KMid in Linux, but I have had sucessful reports getting 
   KMid to work on FreeBSD
   If you sucessfully run KMid in other unices, please tell me !

   Currently GUS cards make a little sound when using the oss driver, but are
   not supported officially, I'm looking to find people with GUS cards that 
   want to help me to provide such support (either programming or testing), 
   as I think that if nobody has worried about it it's because there's no 
   need for it ;-) 
    
3. Compiling consoleKMid
-----------------
   Do a configure from the parent directory, then go to the player directory,
   and do a 'make' . Simple , isn't it ?

   By default it will use the external midi device, if you want to use another
   one (fm, awe, or anything else), edit the file main.cc and change the value
   of DEFAULT_DEVICE to the one you want, or specify the -d option as in :

      consolekmid -d 1 mymidifile.mid

4. Installing 
-----------------
   No installing of consoleKMid is actually done, just copy the consoleKMid file
   yourself to where you want (usually /usr/local/bin ). To use the fm device,
   you should specify in fmout.cc the path to where the fm patches are installed
   ( /etc by default)

5. Running
--------------
   Well, it's quite easy, just type "consolekmid" and it should run :-)

6. How do I use a Midi Mapper ?
-------------------------------
   A Midi Mapper is the feature you have been waiting for in Linux for years,
   (at least I have been :-) it makes a non General Midi synth, appear to the
   computer as General Midi compliant. Thus, a GM synth is emulated with a
   nonGM.
   Look the KMid docs for more info on creating/using a midi map.
   If you want to use one with consolekmid, you can use the -M option,
   use it like this example :

      consolekmid -M /opt/kde/share/apps/kmid/maps/YamahaPSS790.map mymidifile

   You can also edit main.cc in the player directory and change the value of
   DEFAULT_MAP to whatever you want, so that you don't need to specify the
   -M option each time you run consolekmid. 

   If you want to define a new map for your midi keyboard, I recommend you to
   start by copying the file yamaha790.map and modifying it. And remember to
   send it to me so that it will be included in future revisions and other
   people can use it !

7. Where can I download KMid and consoleKMid from ?
---------------------------------------------------

   KMid's homepage is at :
   http://www.arrakis.es/~rlarrosa/kmid.html

   From there you can download latest versions as well as know the latest
   changes and improvements of KMid and consoleKMid
	 
8. To do list
---------------
   Support ALSA
   GUS support is nearly done (and also SoftOSS) but still need little 
	improvements
   Better AWE support and use Soundfonts
   The KMidServer and make KMid use it.
