	* CHANGES: Changing from CHANGES to ChangeLog
	* using i18n instead klocale->translate
	* added version number to about box
	* FINALLY FOUND OUT the reason for all this popping and klicking in
	kmedia. It was caused by a hard to find loopback:
	1) maudio hands over the new media position
	2) kmedia sees it and places the position indicator (KSlider) at the
	new position.
	3) KSlider thinks (wrong) the user has dragged the Slider and tells
	maudio about the new wished media position. I am glad this is
	finally resolved. 8-)

     in the mediatool protocol since today.
