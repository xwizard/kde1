<H2><A NAME="usage"></A>Usage:</H2>

<OL>
<LI>Just start kmedia from kpanel or by double-clicking a desktop icon.</LI>

<LI>Drag one Wav from kfm into the kmedia window. The Wav should play now.</LI>

<LI>Press &quot;Stop&quot; or &quot;Pause&quot; to control playback. </LI>

<H2><A NAME="mediaplayer"></A>The media players</H2>

<UL>
<P>The media players are programs, that can play certain media types. There
is one program available for playing wave audio. Soon there will be one
for midi playing, Mod playing and so on. Please note the documentation
below.</P>

<P><B>The player programs below are all copyrighted by their authors. Please
contact them only, if you have problems with the players. Before contacting
them, please try the original program, as these versions are patched by
me.</B></P>

<P><B>Contact me, if you have problems with kmedia, maudio and the mediatool
library. You should contact me too, when you have no trouble with the original
player program, but with the patched one.</B></P>

<H2><A NAME="TODO"></A>TODO:</H2>

<UL>
<LI>Reimplement support for sidplay, tracker and playmidi.</LI>

<LI>Support timidity, sidplay, MPEG and more media types.</LI>

<LI>Allow &quot;OSS bugflags&quot; to be set. As the OSS driver seems to
be pretty buggy with many cards, I have activated the bugflags by default.
(Change is only possible in maudio.cpp currently).</LI>
</UL>

<H2><A NAME="BUGS"></A>BUGS:</H2>

<UL>
<LI>kmedia and maudio eat up CPU time even when being &quot;idle&quot;.
This problem and it solution is known already.</LI>

<LI>Multiple window support does not work 100%. Closing the application when
multiple windows were open
can leave "maudio" processes running, which you have to kill explicitely.</LI>

<H2><A NAME="Changelog"></A>Changelog:</H2>

<UL>
<P><B>V0.1</B> Initial revision. Only one mediatool capable player included:
tracker, a Soundtracker module (<I>*.mod</I>) player.</P>

<P><B>V0.2</B> Reworked UI completely: New Layout, smaller window, new
icons. Has a scrollbar as position indicator. Easier compilation procedure.</P>

<P><B>V0.3</B> Mediatool capable midi (<I>*.mid</I>) player included. Much
more KDE &quot;awareness&quot;. Technically speaking, kmedia is now a KDE
core application, which fulfills all creteria given in the RFCs: Has a
menubar, has standard keybindings, ...</P>

<P><B>V0.4</B> Mediatool capable audio (<I>*.wav</I>) player included.
Supports DnD. Uses Statusbar. Can open multiple windows. Multiple windows
support actually works (see <A HREF="#BUGS">BUGS</A> section though). SHM
segments are freed automatically when unused, ...</P>

<P><B>V0.45</B> Updated to new FSSTND and shortcut standard. Uses
KIconLoader. Fixed lockups. This is the version being sent out with Beta1.
