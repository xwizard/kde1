- Use QBoxLayout Class or libkresize???

For V1.10
- Cleanup code, create a class KMedia:
  - k->play(media)
  - k->stop(media)
  - k->pause(media)
  - ...

For V1.15
- Make it possible to make entrys into kpanel (play, forward, next track,
  ...) ??? Could be simply implemented as mini-programs. Then create a
  *.kdelnk for each button/program.

For V2.0
- Major protocol revision: Message passing, TCP, net capabilities
- Implement the directed text exchange protocol (Slave ---> Master).

For V2.0 or later
- Special configuration data, such as sidplay filter settings could be
  setup by an external program. This is to be called by the slave (or
  the master???), again with a -media option. The slave creates during
  his initialization phase a new chunk, e.g. MdCh_SidFilterSettings.
