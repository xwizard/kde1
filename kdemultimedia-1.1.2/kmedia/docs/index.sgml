<sect>Introduction

<p>
KMedia is KDE's generic media player. The base system comes with the
ability to play digital audio data (WAV) through KDE's audio server.
You will need the KDE base system (kdelibs + kdebase) for this.
It can be extended by writing mediatool compliant player modules.

<sect>Installation
<p>
<sect1>How to obtain KMedia
<p>
KMedia is a core application of the KDE project <url url="http://www.kde.org">.
KMedia can be found on <url url="ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/kde/">, the main ftp site
of the KDE project.

<sect1>Requirements
<p>
In order to successfully compile KMedia, you need the latest versions of <tt> libkdecore</tt>
and <tt> libkdeui</tt>. All required libraries as well as KMedia itself can be found
on <url url="ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/kde/">. 



<sect1>Compilation and installation
<p>

In order to compile and install KMedia on your system, type the following in the base 
directory of the KMedia distribution:
<tscreen><verb>
% ./configure
% make
% make install
</verb></tscreen>


Since KMedia uses <tt>autoconf</tt> you should have not trouble compiling it.
Should you run into problems please report them to the <sf/KDE/ mailing lists.

<sect>Onscreen Fundamentals
<p>

KMedia usage is simple. Start the program and drag a WAV file into the
window. The file will be played immediately. If the file does not get played
your sound device might be busy.


<p>

<sect1>Buttons
<p>
The meaning of all buttons should be well known. If you can operate a tape deck or
CD Player, you should have no problem in using KMedia. Only applicable buttons
are usable. For example, ejecting a CD makes sense, but not ejecting a WAV Media.



<sect1>Multiple media players
<p>
You can open multiple KMedia windows. Either by using File->New view
or by starting another media player through kpanel.

If you want KMedia to use a specific output device (e.g. soundcard)
you can set it in kmedia's configuration dialog. Attention: This is
currently unimplemented!!!
You can set  the device using numbers. 0 means the default
device, 1 the primary, 2 the secondary device and so on.
