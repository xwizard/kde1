TODO
====
o deal with interfaces different from ppp0
o button for clearing volume accounting

o Separate GUI and non-GUI code in different classes


Dropped

  be SUID)

Done
====
o signal catching for accounting
o help users with those "pppd died unexpected..." bugs
o CHAP support
o All modem related code should be put in one class
o replace "$" in config entries with "$$"
