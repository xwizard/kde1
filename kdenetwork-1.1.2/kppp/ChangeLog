1999-08-25  Harri Porten  <porten@kde.org>

	* main.cpp: work around copy&paste password bug by using a widget
	derived from QLineEdit that disables that overrides the buggy methods.
	* runtests.cpp (ppp_available): until our check can cope with the
	PPP code in 2.3 Linux kernels we'll simply skip that test for
	versions higher than 2.2.

1999-08-17  Harri Porten  <porten@kde.org>

	* modem.cpp: disabled CD line test. Responsible for too many problems.

1999-08-07  Harri Porten  <porten@kde.org>

	* modem.cpp: removed the "Mode 7bit" CompuServe hack after I saw
	that `chat' is always masking incoming data with 0x7F. The 7bit
	command was a scripting command and wouldn't have any effect
	before (and I read a posting from someone getting garbled text
	when dialing). Now we are back to the behaviour <= KDE 1.1 and
	CompuServe users won't need any extra scripting commands.
	Let's implement a real parity and data bit handling in the KDE 2.0
	branch. The current solution wasn't perfect. 

1999-07-22  Harri Porten  <porten@kde.org>

	* connect.cpp: visualize \n as <LF> in setExpect()'s debug messages
	* logviewer: rename `log' variable to `logList' to avoid clash with
	mathematical function on some systems. 
	* logview/loginfo.cpp: added mystrsep() function as strsep()
	replacement which is not POSIX compliant.

1999-07-19  Harri Porten  <porten@kde.org>

	* pppdata.cpp: fixed a cause of those "Timeout expired" errors: if 
	the user never set the speed of the serial port gpppdata would return
	an empty string as speed(). The modem initialization code would
	fall back to 57600 but no speed would be passed to pppd. Whatever
	pppd does in this case (I haven't checked the sources yet) breaks the
	negotiation process.

1999-07-13  Harri Porten  <porten@kde.org>

	* added "Mode 7bit" and "Mode 8bit" script commands for CompuServe
	users. 7bit will simply strip off the highest bit to deal with the
	incoming 7E1 data. Write operations are not affected.
	* modem.cpp: try a tcsendbreak() if tcgetattr() fails. Ask for
	feedback if that solved the "modem is busy" error for anyone.
	* modem.cpp: read data in multiple chunks of up to 200 bytes. This 
	should speed up things and avoid problems with the socket notifier. 

1999-07-11  Harri Porten  <porten@kde.org>

	* connect.cpp: moved some code from readChar() into checkBuffers() 
	to clean up the setExpect() race condition fix.

1999-07-06  Harri Porten  <porten@kde.org>

	* modem.cpp: adhere to the lock file format described in the
	Serial HOWTO (10 digits pid and a newline).
	* edit.cpp: fixed highlighting in ScriptWidget
	* connect.cpp: fixed race condition that might have lead to data not
	being caught by "Expect" (found by Arch Harris <arch@cs.jmu.edu>)

1999-06-11  Harri Porten  <porten@kde.org>

	* pppdata.cpp: line termination will default to CR instead of CR/LF.

1999-06-10  Harri Porten  <porten@kde.org>

	* modem.cpp: fixed check for stale lock file ((s)traced down by
	Duane Ellis <duane@skyhigh.com>)

1999-04-30  Harri Porten  <porten@kde.org>

	* conwindow.cpp: fixed deleting of old geometry layout
	* logview/loginfo.cpp: added #include <string.h> for strsep
	* "PPP support missing" is no longer fatal. Just a warning.
	* pppstatdlg.cpp: update statistic data even if widget is not visible.
	(patch by  Bastien Chevreux <B.Chevreux@dkfz-heidelberg.de>)

=========================== KDE 1.1.1 released =============================

1999-04-24  Harri Porten  <porten@kde.org>

	* runtests.cpp: test for `lock' in /etc/ppp/options is not needed any-
	more, thanks to a hint from Paul Mackeras (pppd). Leaving away ttySx
	(99/04/10) from the command line and binding stdin/stdout to the
	device (99/01/12) stops pppd from trying to lock the device itself.

1999-04-10  Harri Porten  <porten@kde.org>

	* connect.cpp: solved problems with pppd 2.3.6 and 2.3.7
	* pppdata.cpp: PPPDebug() defaults to `false'.
	* opener.cpp: introduced MY_ASSERT macro. We don't want to see our
	security checks disabled by the NDEBUG flag.

1999-04-09  Harri Porten  <porten@kde.org>

	* modem.cpp: improved protection against socket notifier zombie as
	suggested by Brian Fisher <fisherb@hotdog.ccs.queensu.ca>.


1999-04-06  Harri Porten  <porten@kde.org>
	* modem.cpp: set modemfd to -1 in closetty().
	* modem.cpp: block attempts to start the socket notfier if modemfd < 0.
	* connect.cpp: call closetty() _before_ execppp(). This should solve
	some of the reported timeout errors and the observed memory hogging.
	* modem.cpp: added stop() in closetty() (just to be sure)
	(all fixes above were proposed by Ian Gordon <ig@cs.strath.ac.uk>)
	* requester.cpp: setpppdRunning(false) _before_ killing the pppd.

1999-03-26  Harri Porten  <porten@kde.org>

	* main.cpp: added flushX() before every command_execute()
	* increased maximum modem string size
	* store child pid in helper_pid instead of gpppdata.* (safer) 

1999-03-20  Harri Porten  <porten@kde.org>

	* connect.cpp: fixed "unknown speed" bug introduced in previous version

1999-03-15  Harri Porten  <porten@kde.org>

	* opener.cpp: replaced regex library calls with self-written matching
	algorithm. This hopefully prevents the segfaults reported with SuSE
	and Caldera binaries. (Update: identified the assert() around regcomp()
	as the bug. It was left out when compiling with NODEBUG) 
	* connect.cpp: fixed bugs of internal scripting loop. Possible
	symptoms: broken 'Expect' command and incorrectly parsed modem speed.

1999-03-10  Harri Porten  <porten@kde.org>

	* modem.cpp: dropped ISTRIP option and made everything else "8-bit
	clean" by using unsigned char and removing 0x7F AND'ing. Characters
	like [§´°äöü] will work now.
	* conwindow.cpp (ConWindow): initialise volinfo after discovering that
	this prevents a segfault with Qt2.0 (turned out to be a beta bug only)

1999-03-09  Harri Porten  <porten@kde.org>

	* opener.cpp: utilize CMSG_LEN macro if present
	* opener.cpp: insert LF if missing at end of *-secrets file
	* opener.cpp: supply REG_NOSUB flag to regcomp

1999-03-05  Harri Porten  <porten@kde.org>

	* requester.cpp: relaxed check for msg_controllen due to alignment
	problems on different hardware architectures (eg. Alphas). Proposed
	by Martin Ostermann <ost@comnets.rwth-aachen.de>
	* removed unused or doubled code

=========================== KDE 1.1 released ==============================
	
1999-02-04  Harri Porten  <porten@kde.org>

	* main.cpp: remove stale pidfile before creating new the
	one. Otherwise creation with O_EXCL fails.
	* runtests.cpp: removed securityTest(). $HOME check wasn't fully
	functional and not needed anymore.
	* runtests.cpp: re-enabled test for pppd's s-bit if eff. uid != 0.

1999-02-03  Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* fixed a bug in my testing code

1999-02-02  Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* the value of the environment var $HOME is no longer trusted,
	  kppp now uses getpwent() to find out the home directory.

	* the pidfile is now created with O_EXCL

	* added new portugal rules

	* executable accounting rulesets are now disabled (will re-enable
	  after KDE 1.1)

	* fixed a bug that caused the throughput graph display
          unreasonable high numbers

1999-01-31  Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* fixed a security bug (stdout or stderr closed on program start)

1999-01-28  Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* fixed a bug in opener.cpp. recvmsg() was interrupted, and thus
	the SUID part died.

1999-01-28  Harri Porten  <porten@kde.org>

	* modem.cpp: use sigsetjmp() instead of just setjmp() to solve
	freeze when modem is powered off (bug#267)

1999-01-27  Harri Porten  <porten@kde.org>

	* pppstats.cpp: removed debug output
	* opener.cpp: delay closing the tty fd. Otherwise the ioctl() in
	execpppd() can't succeed.
	* opener.cpp: ignore TERM and INT signals. This is probably the
	best until a safe clean-up & terminate routine is written.
	* connect.cpp: added a removedns() call to cancelbutton().

1999-01-25  Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* updated and regenerated documentation
	
1999-01-23  Harri Porten  <porten@kde.org>

	* main.cpp: config data wasn't saved on immediate exit.

1999-01-22  Harri Porten  <porten@kde.org>

	* moved pppd call to the server process. It should be safer and
	much more comfortable that pppd doesn't need to be installed SUID
	root anymore. If I don't get any negative feedback I'll remove
	some doubled code later. 

1999-01-17  Harri Porten  <porten@kde.org>

	* modeminfo.cpp: ATI1 was left out. Wait 0.1 secs to process the ATE0.

1999-01-14  Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* Most windows should now have the mini-icon
	* the lineedit for the modem timeout was too narrow to see at
	least 2 characters. Fixed it, now shows at least 4 chars
	* double-clicking an account in the account-listbox now opens 
	the account for editing, as expected
	* for some weird reason, the lineedit showing costs and volume
	were both editable, thus letting users think they can edit
	it. Fixed that.

1999-01-12  Harri Porten  <porten@kde.org>

	* connect.cpp: become the session leader and let ttySx be the
	controlling terminal before launching pppd. This might solve
	timeout problems several people reported, ie. when kppp was
	started from kpanel instead of a terminal window.
	* main.cpp: the kppp.sh workaround for make_directories() isn't
	needed anymore and confused a few people.
	* requester.cpp: convert cmsglen to size_t to make the compiler happy.
	* modem.cpp: fixed usleep() replacement in case #ifndef HAVE_USLEEP
	* connect.cpp: saving of old_hostname was broken

1999-01-10  Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* complete rework of the accounting system. The old implementation
	did only allow one type of accounting (=via rulefiles). The new
	will allow executable rulefiles too.
	
1999-01-06  Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* added new hungarian rules
	* the title of the main window was "kppp.bin". Fixed this.
	* the combobox for selecting the account to dial in was
	editable for some strange reason. Fixed.
	* modified the testing stuff (-T now)

1999-01-04  Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* began to add a modem database. See README.ModemDB for
	details. The modem DB will not make it into KDE 1.1 (sorry)

1999-01-05  Harri Porten  <porten@kde.org>

	* opener.cpp: set O_NOCTTY flag when opening the modem device to
	hinder the server process from being assigned a controlling terminal
        (and 'stealing' it from pppd ?)
	* pppdata.h: renamed "LockFile" key to "UseLockFile" to prevent a
	clash with kppprc's from KDE 1.0. (reported by Seth Rothberg
	<sethr@crocker.com>)
        * umask(0) in suid child to avoid permission conflicts with lock file.
	* connect.cpp,opener.*,requester.*: moved call to sethostname()
	into Opener. Bug discovered by Matthew Ando <ando@math.jhu.edu>


1999-01-04  Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* Updated Hungarian rules
	* removed all Qt calls from log to make it safe to use in
	opener.cpp
	* replace Debug() calls in opener.cpp with the function
	provided by log.cpp
	* clarified comments in opener.cpp
	* replaced the button "Ok" with a "Exit" button when another
	instance of kppp was found. This clarifies the action when
	pressing the button.
	* added a .kdelnk file for the log-viewer

1998-12-28  Harri Porten  <porten@kde.org>

        * opener.cpp: netinet/in.h is needed on FreeBSD
	* reverse order of dropping suid rights (first setgid, then
	setuid) to avoid an EPERM error (doesn't make a difference on Linux)
	* requester/opener: removed transmission of filename. I discovered
	problems with the variable string length and it wasn't used
	anyway.
	
1998-12-27  Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* moved gpppdata.setpppdError(0) to end of dieppp()
	* the "Don´t show this hint again" option is now immediatly saved

1998-12-26  Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* gpppdata.pppdError() was never reset, causing a bunch of error
	  windows to appear. Should be fixed.
	* cosmetic changes in various files for better readability	

1998-12-25  Harri Porten  <porten@kde.org>

	* kpppconfig.h: include <sys/param.h> to get the BSD define.
	#include <config.h> was missing too. This prevented several #ifdefs
	from doing the right thing.

1998-12-24  Harri Porten  <porten@kde.org>

	* runtests.cpp: relaxed my previously enforced suid check for pppd

1998-12-23  Harri Porten  <porten@kde.org>

	* runtests.cpp, opener.cpp: fixed FreeBSD compile problem reported by Hans
	Petter Bieker

1998-12-22  Harri Porten  <porten@kde.org>

	* pppdata.cpp: Give users upgrading from KDE 1.0 instructions how
	to modify their kppprc if it is owned by root (KConfig bug back then).

1998-12-21  Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* opener.cpp: using umask now instead of chmod (more safe)
	* opener.cpp: regfree was called too late. Fixed.
	* re-enable scripts when using CHAP or PAP
	* cosmetic changes in the "Accounts" widget

1998-12-21  Harri Porten  <porten@kde.org>

	* opener.h: define system dependend type cast for struct iovec's
	iov_base. FreeBSD needs (char *) instead (void *).

1998-12-20  Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* added Germany Mannesmann Arcor ruleset

1998-12-20  Harri Porten  <porten@kde.org>

	* docking.cpp: call KWM::activate() on connection window after
	being re-opened from docking icon (recommended by Matthias on
	kde-devel)
	* ppplog.cpp: re-introduced reading messages with fgets() instead
	of single chars. Should be faster.
	* ppplog.cpp: worked on diagnostic messages

1998-12-18  Harri Porten  <porten@kde.org>

	* #include "auth.h" was needed after pap.h was removed
	* opener.h: workaround for glibc bug in RedHat 5.0. Since there is
	presumably no way to detect the exact release version we'll simply
	define SCM_RIGHTS to be 1 for every glibc2.0 on Linux. This should
	solve the conflict with the kernel.  

1998-12-18  Harri Porten  <porten@kde.org>

	* removed pap.* and chap.* files and moved their code in
	requester.cpp where all setuid root stuff is gathered now.
	* requester.cpp: rewrote PAP/CHAP so that the setuid part is free
	of any Qt/X calls. 

1998-12-16  Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* added Indonesia rule files
	* added some new Denmark rule files
	* added a patch from Filip Larsen <filip@post4.tele.dk> to allow a
	  rule to be dependent on connection time. See Rules/TEMPLATE for
	  an example. This will allow much better danish rulesets

1998-12-14  Harri Porten  <porten@kde.org>

	* runtests.cpp: fixed test for pppd's suid bit
	* requester.cpp: initialize struct control (may be necessary for
	some kernel versions)
	* runtests.cpp: use Requester to check write access to modem (PPP Test)

1998-12-13  Harri Porten  <porten@kde.org>

	* use hardcoded lock file path (kpppconfig.h)
	* tighten interface between Requester/Opener by transmitting
	device index instead of device path 
	* do a fchown(fd, 0, 0) on lock file

1998-12-08  Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* added Denmark rules
	* added Luxembourg rules
	* commented out the no-longer need CHAP_* functions
	* removed the old/never used setup program
	* cleaned up accounting (set umask, no chown/chmod)
	* cleaned up PPP log (set umask, no SUID check)

1998-12-05  Harri Porten  <porten@kde.org>

	* connect.cpp: killpppd() and stop if_timeout_timer in cancelbutton()
	* main.cpp: ignore SIGCHLDs in shutDown()
	* main.cpp: interface timeout error wasn't displayed anymore
	* modem.cpp: check for possible existance of stale lockfile before
	trying it to open via Requester::rq->openLockFile(). The resulting
	error message on failure was too confusing.
	* main.cpp: ignore SIGHUPs in child process

1998-12-04  Harri Porten  <porten@kde.org>

	* requester.cpp: disable alarm() for now, silence some debug messages

1998-12-01  Harri Porten  <porten@kde.org>

	* main.cpp: notify user about death of helper process and abort

1998-11-28  Harri Porten  <porten@kde.org>

	* main.cpp: restored accidentally deleted line (setPassword())
	* connect.cpp: suppress warnings from QStrList

1998-11-26  Harri Porten  <porten@kde.org>

	* included errno.h in opener.cpp and modified CMSG_DATA()'s
	argument (as suggested by Andreas Pour).
	* had to revert to SOCK_DGRAM since I keep getting failed
	assertions. Using a stream seems to require some attention in
	terms of ensuring that the correct length is received.

1998-11-26  Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@kde.org>
	
	* added missing rules for Switzerland, and added kppp.sh
	* replace SOCK_DGRAM by SOCK_STREAM, and hope that it works

1998-11-26  Harri Porten  <porten@kde.org>

	* requester.cpp: made the ifdef's for cmsg_data more portable
	* requester.cpp, opener.cpp: include sys/uio.h to define struct
	iovec. As far as I can see this should work for systems with and
	without glibc. If it doesn't, please mail me directly.
 
1998-11-25  Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* fixed a lot of rulefiles. Pentecost Monday is NOT easter+60,
	  but easter+50. My TEMPLATE file contained this bug,
	  and unfortunatly a lot of people copied it.
	* improved and new Switzerland rulefiles

1998-11-24  Harri Porten  <porten@kde.org>

	* main.cpp: store pid of setuid child in PPPData object
        * define KERNEL_VERSION()

1998-11-24  Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* fixed opener.cpp for Linux >= 2.1.0
	* removed PAP_UsePAP(), no longer needed

1998-11-23  Harri Porten  <porten@kde.org>

	* requester.cpp: removed ancient #include "requester.moc"

1998-11-22  Harri Porten  <porten@kde.org>

	* main.cpp: fixed freeze on disconnect by using waitpid(...,
	WNOHANG) instead of wait()
	* main.cpp: forgot to convert gpppdata.password to char*
	* opener.cpp: close file descriptors after being sent. Left out
	dup() call. Did it serve any special purpose ?
	* opener.h: increased allow size for username and passwords
	* modem.cpp: included config.h for HAVE_USLEEP
	(thanks to hpj.lisa@t-online.de (hpj) for reporting this)
	* PAP/CHAP: fixed typo and return value
		
1998-11-20  Harri Porten  <porten@kde.org>

	* First draft of a client&server archicture consisting of setuid
	child process that will serve requests for file manipulation from
	the parent. The parent is doing all the GUI operations is running
	with normal user privileges. Assuming the approx. 300 lines still
	running setuid root will be intensively reviewed this should
	result in a kppp far less vulnerable to security exploits.
	* added requester.* and opener.*
	* TODO: - handle signals (SIGCHLD, SIGPIPE?)
		- get ppp_available() running (presumably broken now)
		- speed up reading the syslog (reading single chars now)

1998-11-17  Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* another security hole fixed: the function make_directories() is
	  no longer used, instead of a shell script make those directores.
	  Since shell scripts do not run suid, this should be safe
	* fixed a bug in the main.cpp, at the calls to setPAPSecret() and
	  setCHAPSecret().
	* fixed (void*)new Opener(...) to (void)new Opener(...)

1998-11-17  Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* Security fix: fixed possible buffer overflow in findFileInPath()
	* Security fixes: re-checked all char[] on stack to be suid-safe
	  If it is considere to be safe, a comment was added to the end of
	  line

1998-11-17  Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@kde.org>	

	* removed another "extern" by making Accounting::getCosts(...) static

1998-11-17  Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* further improvements in ppp-log wizard
	* runtests.cpp: test for Qt >= 1.40 before include header files

1998-11-11  Harri Porten  <porten@kde.org>

	* connect.cpp: allow a little delay after sending the volume
	string. Prevents it from getting eaten by the next command.
	Thanks to Craig Goodrich <craig@airnet.net> for providing the patch.

1998-11-11  Harri Porten  <porten@kde.org>

	* runtests.cpp: added header file to solve compilation problems

1998-11-04  Harri Porten  <porten@kde.org>

	* got rid of two global variables

1998-11-04  Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* kppp now checks itself if the kernel supports PPP (Linux only
	for now. If anyone wants this for another system - implement it!)
	* before dialing out, the check for PPP support is repeated, if
	the kernel module was unloaded between running the tests and the
	actual dialing, it will reloaded again	

1998-11-01  Harri Porten  <porten@kde.org>

	* modemcmds.cpp: added a wait&CR&wait sequence before sending the
	init string. This seems to be necessary to avoid locking some modems.

1998-10-29  Harri Porten  <porten@kde.org>

	* connect.cpp: fixed search&replace typo

1998-10-26  Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* incorporated new Netherland rules (NetPoint)

1998-10-25  Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* added updated rules for Spain

1998-10-06  Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* repaired Makefile.am and reverted Hans Petter Bieker's changes
	to something more usefull.
	* added SecurityWidget, but currently there's not much use for
	this widget. Later on, it will allow root to specify who may use
	kppp and pppd.
	* removed the global variable miniIcon
	* removed the global variable dock_widget, replaced with a static
	class variable
	* added lockdevice() and unlockdevice() to the class modem. This
	will finally allow us to have a modem class which handles the
	device locking itself (yeah...)
	* removed the global var "modem", now a static member of the class
	"Modem"
	* modem.cpp: removed some global vars

1998-10-14  Harri Porten  <porten@kde.org>

	* pppdata.cpp: don't care about CD line by default. We'll receive
	too many "bug reports" otherwise.

1998-10-13  Harri Porten  <porten@kde.org>

	* ppplog.cpp: offer some advice based on keywords found in the log
	(very primitive so far, but may be extended later)

1998-10-09  Harri Porten  <porten@kde.org>

	* modem.cpp: additional data flushes
	* pppdata.cpp: don't need workaround for '$' with recent kde libraries

1998-10-05  Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* better QuickHelp text, proof-read by a native english
	speaker. Thanks a lot to Martin A. Brown for doing this!

1998-10-04  Harri Porten  <porten@kde.org>

	* miniterm.cpp: fixed toolbar

1998-10-03  Harri Porten  <porten@kde.org>

	* modem.cpp: disentangled Modem class from other Widgets, i.e.
	removed the Multiple Inheritance I introduced earlier.
	Drawback: another global pointer :(
	* main.cpp: since KConfig neglects the real user id when creating
        config files we have to give kppprc back to the user ourself.
	* connect.cpp: pass something more useful to parseModemSpeed()	
	* removed lots of unused/redundant code and variables

1998-10-02  Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* fixed that stupid segfault combined with the throughput graph
	* "make" did not set the suid bit anymore. Why? However, I fixed
	that

1998-09-29  Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* fixed a bug in the graphing code
	* runtests.cpp: fixed typos

1998-09-28  Harri Porten  <porten@kde.org>

	* ppplog.cpp: reduce memory consumption, small fixes
	* pppdata.cpp: fixed segfaults caused by non-readable kppprc

1998-09-28  Harri Porten  <porten@kde.org>

	* runtests.cpp: bail out if some evil-doer has manipulated $HOME

1998-09-26  Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* cosmetic changes in ppplog.cpp

1998-09-24  Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* Ownership of PPP logfiles corrected to the real, not the
	effective user id

1998-09-23  Harri Porten  <porten@kde.org>

	* ppplog.cpp: skip remote message if empty
	* ppplog.cpp: fixed segfault triggered by virgin log files

1998-09-21  Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* introducing quickhelp
	* forgot to add i18n to quickhelp entries, fixed this

1998-09-20  Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* PPP-arguments dialog reworked	

1998-09-19  Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* more QuickHelp
	* began to clean up layout management, it's a mess
	* added setup widget for the throughput graph
	* some code cleanups

1998-09-16  Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* Added some more QuickHelp
	* The QLineEdit for fixed IP and netmask is not re-initialized
	with  "0.0.0.0" whenever you select "dynamic IP"
	* the scripting widget is disabled if authentication PAP or CHAP
	is selected
	
1998-09-15  Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* replaced strings that span several lines with multiple
	strings, it seems that this was a GCC-only feature

1998-09-11  Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* more code cleanups
	* fixed a bug in log.h (semicolon after a macro definition --
	brrr)
	* added quickhelp to many setup dialogs

1998-09-05  Harri Porten  <porten@kde.org>

	* pppdata.cpp: fixed warnings
	* replaced readListConfig calls with calls to readWholeListConfig
	* and removed 'Whole' from function names afterwards
	* connect.cpp: sped up scripting loop by reducing calls to gpppdata

1998-08-29  Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* In ConnectWidget::readtty(): after a newline or CR is received,
	the QSocketnotifier is disabled for 20ms to avoid reading too
	much, e.g. the start characters of the ppp protocol.
	* added compile option "NO_GRAPH" to disable the graph
	* removed the compile options "COMPILE_PIX" in pppstatsdlg.cpp,
	this is no longer needed or supported

1998-08-27  Harri Porten  <porten@kde.org>

	* ppplog.cpp: use short named header file to keep Qt 1.33 users happy

1998-08-25  Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* removed all QTimers for reading tty output, a QSocketNotifier is
	now used. Much better response time now, lower CPU usage!
	* "prompt" was deleted in the ConnectWidget destructor. Removed
	that
	* added telephone rule for Malaysia	

1998-08-24  Harri Porten  <porten@kde.org>

	* connect.cpp: re-enabled closeEvent()
        * pppdata.cpp: dumped writeListConfig(). Will do the same with
        readListConfig() too ... next week.

1998-08-22  Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* some KDE style guide conformant changes
	* some code cleanups
	* removed -lkfile and -lkfm from Makefile.am
	* added debug switch to pppd command line when debugging
	is turned on
	* Improved the response time for modem output. Modem output is
	polled in longer intervals, if data is pending the polling time
	is shortened, otherwise the polling time is set back to it´s 
	original, rather high value
	* re-worked the "About" widget. It was time to save poor old Bernd
	from receiving bug-reports.
	* miniterm.cpp: code cleanups
	* improved responseness of MiniTerm, reduced CPU load
	* MiniTerm adheres to KDE Standards now (Help-Menu, ...)
	* The ATI query was broken. Fixed.
	* Improved the ATI query result window
	* modeminfo.cpp: code cleanups
	* main.cpp: code cleanup, banner updated
	* repaired the german "Tele-2" ruleset (was broken due to invalid
	characters)
	* added improved ruleset for Italy (thanks to Michele Manzato for
	supplying this ruleset)
	* fixed a few typos in the TEMPLATE
	* prepared a replacement for the debug-window
	* connwindow.cpp: code cleanups
	* began to remove the code dependencies between main.cpp
	(KPPPWidget) and the setup GUI components. This will help
	to separate the dialer and the setup later
	* general.cpp: code cleanups
	* accounts.cpp: removed as many references to p_kppp as possible,
	using signal/slots instead of. There´s only on occurence of p_kppp
	left
	* general.cpp: removed the mysterious function itoa (nowhere used)
	* various files: a lot of code cleanups, removed many references
	to extern variables, reduced the amount of functions called from
	p_kppp directly (done with signal/slots now)	
	* Added a new parser for modem speeds. The results are much better
	now, especially for the new K56flex/X2/V.90 modems (where
	different speeds are used for RX/TX)
	* removed tons of "#ifdef MY_DEBUG" and replaced them with
	functions "Debug", which is provided in log.cpp and is a
	"printf()" like function
	* added modem volume selector to the setup.
	
1998-08-21  Harri Porten  <porten@kde.org>

	* use SIGINT instead of SIGHUP to end a connection
	* implemented command line option 'kppp -k' that will
	terminate a connection
	
1998-08-21  Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* Added a graphical display of the current modem line
	throughput.
	* Added an assistent for those "ppp has died" messages
	* Evaluating remote system messages now
	
1998-08-19  Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@kde.org>
	
	* added function to create a ppp - log
	* connect speed improvements

1998-08-18  Harri Porten  <porten@kde.org>

	* fixed security leak in execute_command(): drop setgid root and
	close file descriptors

1998-08-17  Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* fixed a bug in runtest.cpp that caused a segfault (fclose()
	called twice)

1998-08-17  Harri Porten  <porten@tu-harburg.de>

	* main.cpp: added SIGHUP handler that will cleanly disconnect an
	existing connection.

1998-08-09  Harri Porten  <porten@tu-harburg.de>

	* miniterm.cpp: switched to QMenuBar, fixed memory leak

1998-08-08  Harri Porten  <porten@tu-harburg.de>

	* modem.cpp: fixed hangup that occured if the modem power was off.
	hangup() aborts after 2 seconds if it doesn't suceed. 

1998-08-06  Harri Porten  <porten@tu-harburg.de>

	* runtests.cpp: scan up to 100 lines when searching for the
	unwanted 'lock' in /etc/ppp/options and recognize the '#' sign
	to avoid a false alarm
	
1998-08-04  Harri Porten  <porten@tu-harburg.de>

	* fixed replacement for systems without a BSD 4.2 style usleep()
	* modem.cpp: continued to move modem related stuff to modem.cpp.
	The new Modem class is inherited by the Connect-, MiniTerm- and
	ATI-Query Widget for now. This should be way easier to maintain and
	will reduce the binary's size.
	* modeminfo.cpp: cleaned up  
	
1998-08-02  Harri Porten  <porten@tu-harburg.de>

	* opentty(): fixed XON/XOFF flow control
	* closetty(): flush data not read or transmitted
	* main.cpp: enforce killpppd()
	* modem.cpp: moved lockdevice(), unlockdevice() and modemspeed()
	into this newly created file. opentty(), closetty() and hangup()
	should follow soon to let them be shared between widgets.

1998-07-30  Harri Porten  <porten@tu-harburg.de>

	* connect.cpp: take the burden of specifying the modem lock file
	from the user. Just entering the directory should be easier and
	safer. Presets for different systems can be found in kpppconfig.h 

1998-07-29  Harri Porten  <porten@tu-harburg.de>

	* macros.h: replaced remaining MAX with QMAX
	* main.cpp: followed recommendation of the Unix Programming FAQ to
	use _exit() instead of exit() in child processes  

1998-07-25  Harri Porten  <porten@tu-harburg.de>

	* connect.cpp: rewrote check for stale lock files. After dropping
	the use of /proc it should work on other platforms now, too.

1998-07-19  Harri Porten  <porten@tu-harburg.de>

	* merged killppp() and terminatepppd() in killpppd()	
	* main.cpp: added execute_command() to launch external programms
	* added "Command Before Disconnect" for people who have to clean
	up before they leave the net

1998-07-11  Harri Porten  <porten@tu-harburg.de>

	* main.cpp: replaced ~/.kde with kdelocaldir() 
	* connect.cpp: hardcoded ´-detach´ as pppd argument

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> KDE 1.0 released <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
	
1998-06-21  Harri Porten  <porten@tu-harburg.de>

	* general.cpp (GeneralWidget): modified checkbox-size to avoid
	warnings from QGManager

1998-06-18  Harri Porten  <porten@tu-harburg.de>

	* edit.cpp (ScriptWidget): deactivated "Use default script"-option
	as long as someone comes up with a default script

1998-06-02  Harri Porten  <porten@tu-harburg.de>

	* replaced klocale->translate() with i18n() and every reference to
	XPPP with KPPP
	* utilize ´kapp´ (defined in kapp.h) instead of the global ´extern
	KApplication *app´
	(Sorry about the large amount of changes, but I couldn´t resist to 
        clean up the code)

1998-06-02  Harri Porten  <porten@tu-harburg.de>

	* pppdata.cpp: removed workaround, since KConfig fix is in place now

Mon Jun  1 16:13:06 1998    Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* kppp did´nt like "$" in modem strings, fixed that
	
Sun May 24 23:39:42 1998  Bernd Johannes Wuebben  <wuebben@math.cornell.edu>

	* Applied FreeBSD patch for the modem devices
	  Affected File:general.cpp pppdata.cpp
	  Look for __FreeBSD__

Mon May 18 19:51:56 1998  Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* introduced a separate log-viewer "kppplogview"
	* removed the no-more needed entry widget for the log-viewer
	* removed test code checking for log viewer

1998-05-15  Harri Porten  <porten@tu-harburg.de>

	* pppdata.cpp: temporary workaround for KConfig bug concerning
	lists without a trailing separator 

Fri May 15 22:27:02 1998    Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@kde.org>
	* removed the writeline("") once again, it does not work

1998-05-12  Harri Porten  <porten@tu-harburg.de>

	* added support for multiple telephone numbers (separated by ':')
	Patch contributed by Sebastian Rittau <srittau@jroger.in-berlin.de>
	
Tue May 12 18:55:02 1998    Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* the format of the accounting logfile has changed to allow
	  easier parsing from external files:
	  
	  the format is:
	  CONNECT_TIME_FROM:CONNECTION_PEER:CURRENCY_SYMBOL: \
	  CONNECT_TIME_UNTIL:SUBTOTAL:TOTAL:BYTES_IN_BYTES_OUT	

	  there´s a small tcl script which converts the log files. Simply
	  use "tclsh convlog.tcl" will convert all log-files, but NOT
	  delete the old ones.

Mon May  4 17:19:12 1998    Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* Austrian rule files updated
	* LSM updated
	* line-limit for /etc/resolv.conf raised to 128
	* fixed the hard-coded line-limit in removedns() to use
	  MAX_RESOLV_CONF instead (128)	
	* added writeLine("") in connect.cpp to make sure that the modem
	  is in ready state (waiting for AT*)
	* support for internal ISDN cards on Linux via modem emulation 
	  (/dev/ttyI*)

1998-04-30  Harri Porten  <porten@tu-harburg.de>

	* connect.cpp: undid my stupid PAP/CHAP changes from yesterday

1998-04-29  Harri Porten  <porten@tu-harburg.de>

	* connect.cpp: prevented segfault on invalid lockfiles
	* runtests.cpp: /etc/resolv.conf will be created if missing 
	* connect.cpp: fixed reversal of command line options for PAP/CHAP

Tue Apr 28 20:57:04 1998    Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* added CHAP (client side only) authentication

1998-04-27  Harri Porten  <porten@tu-harburg.de>

	* general.cpp (GeneralWidget): command line option "quit after
	end of connection" is availabe via GUI, too.
	* hangup(): made another usleep() adjustable to prevent hanging 
	(thanks to A.D.Y. Cheng <adyc100@hkstar.com> for pointing that out)

Fri Apr 24 18:57:46 1998    Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* general.cpp (GeneralWidget): removed the entry field for
	  the path to the pppd binary

Fri Apr 24 13:03:02 1998    Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* runtests.cpp: kppp now does not allow anymore the user
	  to specify a path to the pppd binary, but searches for
	  it 
	* kppp now checks if pppd is owned by root
	* kppp does not anymore drop suid before starting pppd

Thu Apr 23 22:35:31 1998    Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* Fixed a few security holes: kppp drops suid before executing pppd,
	  checks for buffer overflow with the -c command line switch,
	  drops suid before checking a file with -r

Thu Apr 16 21:21:03 1998  Harri Porten  <porten@tu-harburg.de>

	* main.cpp: set portable locale settings for numerical values,
	since the rulefiles will always have a point as decimal delimiter.

1998-04-15  Harri Porten  <porten@tu-harburg.de>

	* connect.cpp: extended parseargs() to deal with quoted arguments
	* fixed bug in 'Save' that made multiple use impossible.
	* enclosed username and password with quotes to ensure proper
	handling of whitespace characters
	* pap.cpp: fixed regexp to recognize entries in pap-secrets with
	usernames that are either quoted or preceeded by whitspace. Phew !
	That should eliminate one source of these "pppd	died" errors.
	
Mon Apr  6 20:18:40 1998    <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* fixed a volume accounting bug
	* volume accounting is now configureable (bytes in, out, in/out)
	* added new feature (very usefull for sysadmins). If there´s a
	file /etc/kppp.allow, only users from that file may use kppp to
	dial out. Format is one entry per line, comments begin with "#",
	users specified by their login names
	* fixed a bug where the PAP authetication record was only removed
	from /etc/ppp/pap-secrets if an external program is started on 
	login (stupid me :-)	

Wed Apr  1 21:09:05 1998  Harri Porten  <porten@tu-harburg.de>

	* connect.cpp: small fixes for 'Scan'

Tue Mar 31 18:54:13 1998  Harri Porten  <porten@tu-harburg.de>
	
	* connect.cpp: corrected stripping of whitespace from 'scanvar'
	* main scripting loop idles until 'Scan' is completed
	* added new keyword 'Save' to store scanned strings
 	* cleaned up add_domain(), adddns(), removedns() by adding data()
 	calls where QString variables are passed as const char* parameters

Mon Mar 30 22:02:07 1998    <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* added volume accounting (currently, only inbytes are counted,
	but should be very easy to change). Unfortunatly, there´s no
	method yet to reset the number of bytes, so you have to fiddle
	around in kppprc.	

Wed Mar 18 21:47:20 1998  Harri Porten  <porten@tu-harburg.de>

	* runtests.cpp: added check for 'lock' option in /etc/ppp/options.
	Hopefully, this check isn't too harsh and won't cause any false alarms.

Wed Mar 18 01:13:50 1998  Harri Porten  <porten@tu-harburg.de>

	* modemcmds.cpp: replaced 'Modem Sustains Fast Init' (from general.cpp)
	option by an adjustable 'Init Delay'. Some users reported that they
 	had to increase the delay time to prevent kppp from hanging
 	after ATZ.

Mon Mar 16 03:37:04 1998  Bernd Johannes Wuebben  <wuebben@math.cornell.edu>

	* command line options need to be parse after creating a KApplications
	due to some changes by Matthias in kapp I think.

1998-03-15  Mario Weilguni  <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* main.cpp: added mini-icon for all kppp windows, not just 
	  the main window

Mon Mar  9 00:17:20 1998  Bernd Johannes Wuebben  <wuebben@math.cornell.edu>

	* added new script keyword 'scan', see the documentation.
	  It allows for password challenges etc.

Tue Feb 24 19:19:44 1998  Mario Weilguni  <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* pap.cpp, connect.cpp: removed the need for a "+ua" option
	  for PAP. Unfortunatly this REQUIRES that kppp can write
	  /etc/ppp/pap-secrets (either by running SUID root or
	  by group permissions)

Fri Feb 13 01:12:19 1998  Harri Porten  <porten@tu-harburg.de>

	* loginterm.cpp: implemented the possibility to log in via
	a simple terminal window. Should have developed a generic widget
	that could have been shared by Miniterm, the debug window and
	loginterm, but I didn't want to touch the rest of the stuff yet.
	* kpppconfig.h: increased max. script size to 20

Thu Feb  5 22:00:55 1998  Harri Porten  <porten@tu-harburg.de>

	* pppdata.cpp: added pppdError() and setpppdError()
	* main.cpp: added new error message for timeout
	* removed last remaining command_on_disconnect bug (see Jan 24)

Sat Jan 31 19:56:03 1998  Harri Porten  <porten@tu-harburg.de>

	* main.cpp: in some cases kppp connected to an account 
	different from the one selected in the combo box. Added
	setAccount() in connectbutton() to fix that, hopefully.

Sun Jan 25 00:45:45 1998  Harri Porten  <porten@tu-harburg.de>

	* docking.cpp: included a hide() statement to cleanly undock
	the widget from the panel. Otherwise the window stayed invisible
	after one dock/undock-cycle.

Sat Jan 24 03:40:44 1998  Harri Porten  <porten@tu-harburg.de>

	* fixed a bug (occuring twice) that caused the if-statement for
	command_on_connect and command_on_disconnect to be always true.

Fri Jan 23 01:32:57 1998  Harri Porten  <porten@tu-harburg.de>

	* fixed alignment in conwindow.cpp's layout.

Wed Jan 21 03:22:43 1998  Harri Porten  <porten@tu-harburg.de>

	* prevented the password from being left in kppprc after the
 	option 'Store password' has just been turned off
	
	* the ID & password field will be disabled if no account has
	been created yet

	* pppdata.cpp: removed absolute path for default log viewer
	to prevent warning messages upon first startup if KDE's location
 	differs from /usr/local/kde

	* removed gpppdata.Id() and gpppdata.setId() since they have been
	replaced by storedUsername() and setStoredUsername()

Tue Jan 20 15:30:08 1998  Mario Weilguni  <mweilguni@sime.com>

	* Sigh. After unintentionally deleting my account for the sixth
	time, I added a yesNo() dialog to confirm deleting an
	account. This is VERY important, because if you click on "Show
	log" and double-click onto a file to view it and you have the bad
	luck that the filename is just over the "Delete" button, the
	account will be gone.

	* runtests.cpp: gpppdata is now saved after modifications in
	runtests(), and the default log viewer is set correctly

Tue Jan 20 03:10:35 1998  Bernd Johannes Wuebben  <wuebben@math.cornell.edu>

	* tried to get the docking window to display a tooltip with transfer
	bytes statistics. Failed. Need to contact Matthias about it.
       
	* Removed the 'Dock' button. It is superfluous. Use the window
	close button to hide the window.

	* fixed the flicker problem that was reintroduced in pppstatdlg.cpp

	* fixed ( hopefully ) a hangup problem on busy redial caused
	by the  modem_in_connect_state varible in connect.cpp

Mon Jan 19 17:51:16 1998  Mario Weilguni  <mweilguni@sime.com>

	* main.cpp: the setup dialog is now created on demand. Since in
	most cases we only dial out, creating the setup dialog is a waste
	of CPU and memory. This reduces memory by approx 200KB.

	* geometry managment added to PPP statistic window

	* tried to minimize dependencies on "main.h" by removing unneeded
	#includes

	* removed homedir.(cpp|h). It can be easily replaced with
	QDir::homeDirPath().

	* before doing anything else, a few tests will be started to
	ensure that i.e. the pppd binary is found...

Mon Jan 19 12:05:00 1998  Harri Porten  <porten@tu-harburg.de>

	* set default for get_dock_into_panel() to false as safety
	  precaution
	
	* introduced docking. It allows kppp to be run as a small
 	  animated icon on the panel. Clicking on the icon with the left
	  mouse button restores the regular window. The right button
 	  opens up a popup menu with other options.

Mon Jan 19 04:46:39 1998  Bernd Johannes Wuebben  <wuebben@math.cornell.edu>

	* reset PHONENUMBER_SIZE to 60. People with phone cards need lots
	space.

Fri Jan 16 21:41:08 1998  Stephan Kulow  <coolo@kde.org>

	* some improvements to the toplevel Makefile.am. rpath is very
	important for setuid programs

Fri Jan 16 19:04:35 1998  Mario Weilguni  <mweilguni@sime.com>

	* Improved Makefiles. Now documentation and rulesets are correctly
	uninstalled with "make uninstall"

	* Toplevel Makefile.am improved. Subdir traversal is only done for
	installing, not for compiling

	* fixed that "segfault-on-rulecheck" bug introduced by coolo's
	modifications for locale support.

	* RuleSet::checkRuleFile() now returns 0 on success, otherwise
	1. kppp uses this as exit value.

	* fixed a bug in the swiss rulesets

	* added file "checkrules" in Rules. It autochecks all rules found
	and reports bad rulesets.

Thu Jan 15 20:31:14 1998  Mario Weilguni  <mweilguni@sime.com>

	* Ported kppp to use automake. 

	* Since the rulefiles now have separate subdirectories, I have
	removed the prefix (i.e. Spain/Spain_Inovia.rst -->
	Spain/Inovia.rst). Since the old files still exist it should be no
	problem for users of former kppp versions.

	* renamed config.h to kpppconfig.h because it conflicts with the
	default include file config.h, generated from autoconf

Wed Jan 14 12:12:29 1998  Mario Weilguni  <mweilguni@sime.com>

	* main.cpp: pressing Enter in ID_Edit moves focus to PW_Edit, in
	PW_Edit moves focus to the connect-button

Wed Jan 14 04:13:57 1998  Harri Porten  <porten@tu-harburg.de>

	* fixed a bug that caused passwords to be spread among other accounts.
	  Triggering XPPPWidget::entryChanged() had a nasty side effect. 

Tue Jan 13 17:50:07 1998  Bernd Johannes Wuebben  <wuebben@math.cornell.edu>

	* fixed a bug introduced with the creation of the 'execute command
	  on disconnect' option

	* CD is by default off. It doesn't work on my internal modem 
	  and I suspect it might not even work on most (all) internal modems ..

Tue Jan 13 12:02:33 1998  Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@sime.com>
	* the PAP authentication file is now created in the users
	  homedirectory. Otherwise I'd have to create the directory 
	  myself and fix the permissions if kppp runs suid root - 
	  I'm too lazy for that.

	* fixed a security bug in connect.cpp, a typical buffer
	  overflow. Very bad for setuid root programs

Thu Jan 13 06:58:29 1998  Peter Silva <peter.silva@videotron.ca>

	* make new behaviour optional (in response to Bernd's worry 
	  about cheap modems.)

Thu Jan 13 06:58:29 1998  Peter Silva <peter.silva@videotron.ca>

	* patch to prevent kppp hang if modem is off when connecting.


Tue Jan 13 02:48:55 1998  Bernd Johannes Wuebben  <wuebben@math.cornell.edu>

	* applied BSD patch from Alex <garbanzo@hooked.net>
	  (just a few missing includes)

	* various fixes and geometry improvements

	* added a linedit for a command to be executed on disconnect
	

Mon Jan 12 17:18:41 1998  Mario Weilguni  <mweilguni@sime.com>

	* username and password are now remembered between
	session. Remembering the password can be switched off for each
	account.

	* connect.cpp: fixed 2 security bugs in lockfile(). Now it's
	checked if the lockfile is a regular file and no more than
	32 characters are read from this file, no matter how long it is.

	* Added PAP authentication option and code. Using PAP (at least
	client-side-authentication should now be VERY easy. Sorry,
	no CHAP support so far.
	
	* edit.cpp: Added a checkbox if to use kppp's default script.
	If this checkbox is checked, all scriptedit controls are disabled.

Sun Jan 11 21:03:00 1998  Bernd Johannes Wuebben  <wuebben@math.cornell.edu>

	* lslisder in modemcmd.cpp wasn't set correctely on widget
	  creation. 


Thu Jan 11 14:58:29 1998  Peter Silva <peter.silva@videotron.ca>
	* (0.8.10) incorporate iconify_on_connect patch.


Sat Jan 10 21:23:10 1998  Mario Weilguni  <mweilguni@sime.com>

	* main.cpp: fixed a bug that cause kppp to go wild and display
	hundreds of windows when it cannot load a ruleset file

Wed Jan  7 13:00:24 1998  Mario Weilguni  <mweilguni@sime.com>

	* edit.cpp: improved the IP and Gateway widgets

	* various improvements for the geometry managements

Tue Jan  6 12:56:14 1998  Mario Weilguni  <mweilguni@sime.com>

	* modeminfo.cpp (ModemInfo): layoutet the modeminfo dialog
	  and layouted the ModemTransfer dialog (ATI query)

Mon Jan  5 20:59:00 1998  Harri Porten  <porten@tu-harburg.de>

	* accounting.cpp: telephone costs are stored in kppprc now.
	  ~/.kde/share/apps/kppp/Costs is obsolete.
	* pppdata.cpp: added totalCosts() and setTotalCosts().
	  Several small cosmetic changes.  
	
Mon Jan  5 14:25:37 1998  Mario Weilguni  <mweilguni@sime.com>

	* docs/kppp.sgml: updated the docs for the new KDE file system
	  standard. Ispell'ed the docu.

	* main.cpp: added the "-q" command line switch. This is very
	  usefull in combination with "-c". Instead of returning to
	  the kppp main window kppp will exit after disconnecting.

	* Makefile.in: removed the external moc_*.cpp files and
	  included them directly with "#include". This saves 
	  approx. 30 KB in the binary and greatly speeds up 
	  compilation

Mon Jan  5 13:59:20 1998  Mario Weilguni  <mweilguni@sime.com>

	* Rules/TEMPLATE: fixed a typo: the extension of ruleset
	  files is ".rst", not ".rts"

Mon Jan  5 13:42:28 1998  Mario Weilguni  <mweilguni@sime.com>

	* general.cpp: replaced the KIntLineEdit class with the
	  class KIntegerLine from libkdeui. Replaced the progress
	  widget with that from libkdeui.

Mon Jan  5 12:51:43 1998  Mario Weilguni  <mweilguni@sime.com>

	* edit.cpp: now all major dialogs use Qt layout

Mon Jan  5 04:55:58 1998  Bernd Johannes Wuebben  <wuebben@petit.cornell.edu>

	* fixed the while(*it) problem in pppdata.cpp it should be
	  while(it->current()).

Sun Jan  4 13:54:12 1998  Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@sime.com>
	* modified the modemcommands dialog to use the layout
	  classes of Qt. Replaced the scrollbar with a slider,
	  because scrollbars are not the right widget to change
	  values.

Thu Jan  2 00:25:03 1998  Peter Silva <peter.silva@videotron.ca>
	* added modem_in_connect_state, and checks for it
          to avoid unneccessary delays on modem initialization.
	  delay of 2 seconds will still occur on hangup by default.
	  I think that's bearable.
	* Added modem tricks section, gentle introduction.

Thu Dec 25 11:46:34 1997  Bernd Johannes Wuebben  <wuebben@petit.cornell.edu>

        * Added new script keywords: PwPrompt and ID

	* Added programmable guard time around escape sequence
	* Separated escape sequence from hangup command

Sun Dec 21 10:19:18 1997  Peter Silva <peter.silva@videotron.ca>

	* Changed maxloopnest to MAXLOOPNEST for portability reasons 
	  (See developers guide, about const int)
	* Set window titles when connected to account name.

Fri Dec 19 22:49:18 1997  Bernd Johannes Wuebben  <wuebben@petit.cornell.edu>

	* Extended the grammar of the tarif rules. 
	  New keyword: flat_init_costs necessitated by the new french
	  accounting rules.

Tue Dec 16 01:54:50 1997  Bernd Johannes Wuebben  <wuebben@petit.cornell.edu>

	* extended scripting capabilities to allow password dialogs

Sun Nov  2 14:02:31 1997  Bernd Johannes Wuebben  <wuebben@petit.cornell.edu>

	  with fractions too.

	kppp not to create lock files. That is this turn the use of lock files off

	* added option to not disconnect on xserver exit/crash

Sun Aug 10 19:07:07 1997  Bernd Johannes Wuebben  <wuebben@petit.cornell.edu>
