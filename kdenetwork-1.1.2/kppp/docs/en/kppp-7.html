</H3>

<P>
<A NAME="&lt;em/kppp/ FAQ"></A> <H4>I can't get <EM>kppp</EM> to work. <EM>kppp</EM> tells me that pppd has died or that a timeout has expired! </H4>

<P>Did you read the this manual carefully? Here are once more the most common
pitfalls.
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Click on the "Details" button. <EM>kppp</EM> will you give an excerpt from the
PPP log messages (may not work on non-Linux systems, or even on some Linux
distributions). The log will help you to track down the bug.
</LI>
<LI> Make sure that pppd is the actual pppd binary not a script
</LI>
<LI> Make sure that pppd is setuid root. You may set this mode by issuing <I>chmod u+s pppd</I> as root.
</LI>
<LI> Make sure that your <CODE>/etc/ppp/options</CODE> file exists and that it doesn´t contain any conflicting entries. If in doubt: Leave this file empty. 
</LI>
<LI> Using the symbolic link <CODE>/dev/modem</CODE> may cause some conflicts.
Eliminate this source of trouble by using the real device, i.e. <CODE>/dev/cuaX</CODE>
or <CODE>/dev/ttySX</CODE>.
NOTE: COM1 equals ttyS0, COM2 is ttyS1 and so on. </LI>
<LI> Make sure you set the right permission. In case of trouble
you might want to run it as root first and then later, when
everything is working o.k give it less harmful permission if you can not
afford to run <EM>kppp</EM> setuid root. The proper way to proceed would probably
be creating a "modem" group.
</LI>
<LI> You might be launching pppd too early, i.e. before the remote server is
ready to negotiate a PPP connection. If you are using a login script, you
should use the built-in terminal to verify your login procedure. Some 
providers will require you to issue a simple "Send" or "Send ppp" to
launch PPP. Some users even reported, that they had to append "Pause 1" or
"Pause 2" to their script to solve timing conflicts.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>If nothing helps, you might obtain some debugging info from your systems log by issuing:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
# tail /var/log/messages
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<H4><EM>kppp</EM> tells me ``Sorry, can't open the modem''.</H4>

<P>
<P>This means that <EM>kppp</EM> doesn't have permissions to open the modem
device or that you selected a modem device on the Modem Tab Dialog that is
not valid. First make sure you selected the right modem device. Once you are
sure you have selected the right modem device, you must 
give <EM>kppp</EM> the right permission to access the modem 
device and to be able to modify <CODE>/etc/resolv.conf</CODE> in case you want <EM>kppp</EM> to 
configure DNS correctly for you. If you can afford to run <EM>kppp</EM> setuid root
this would solve all access problems for you, if not you will have to figure
out what the right permissions are for your purposes. In order to give
<EM>kppp</EM> setuid root permissions do the following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
% su root
# chown root:root ${KDEDIR}/bin/kppp
# chmod +s ${KDEDIR}/bin/kppp
# exit
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>
<H4><EM>kppp</EM> tells me it can't create a modem lock file.</H4>

<P>This in most instances means that you have installed <EM>kppp</EM>
without SETUID bit on while you, the person executing <EM>kppp</EM>, 
doesn't have write access to the lock file directory which
by default is <CODE>/var/lock</CODE>. This for example is the case on 
Red Hat systems. Check the modem dialog for the
precise location you have chosen. The solution is easy --
either run <EM>kppp</EM> SETUID if you can afford to, or give regular
users write access to <CODE>/var/lock</CODE> or create a modem group
that will have access to the <CODE>/var/lock</CODE> file.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="setuid"></A> <H4>Why is <EM>kppp</EM> installed with the SETUID bit on?</H4>

<P>
<P>There is no need for the SETUID bit, if you know a bit of Unix systems 
administration. Simply create a modem group, add all users that you
want to give access to the modem to that group and make the modem
device read/writable for that group. Also if you want DNS configuration
to work with <EM>kppp</EM>, then <CODE>/etc/resolv.conf</CODE> must be read/writable by the
members of that group. The same counts for
<CODE>/etc/ppp/pap-secrets</CODE> and <CODE>/etc/ppp/chap-secrets</CODE> if
you want to use the built-in PAP or CHAP support, respectively.
<P>Please do not criticise me for installing <EM>kppp</EM> with setuid bit
on, I simply can no longer handle the amount of mail I used to get from
desperate users who had problems getting <EM>kppp</EM> to work because they 
didn't understand enough about Unix and device permissions.
<P>The <EM>kppp</EM> team has lately done a lot of work to make <EM>kppp</EM> setuid-safe. But it's
up to you to decide if you install and how you install it.
<P>You might also want to read the 
<A HREF="kppp-8.html#security">Security</A> section.
<P>
<H4><EM>kppp</EM> just sits there and waits: Expecting OK</H4>

<P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Have you played with the CR/LF setting? Try CR, LF or CR/LF.
</LI>
<LI> Your modem might need some time to respond to its initialisation.
Open the "Modem Commands" dialog on the "Modem" tab and adjust the "Pre-Init"
and "Post-Init" delays. See if you are successful when drastically increasing
their values and do some fine tuning later.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H4><A NAME="autohostname"></A> The connection works fine but I can´t start any applications.</H4>

<P>
<P>You probably have activated the 
<A HREF="kppp-4.html#Auto-configure hostname">Auto-configure hostname</A>
 option and the X Server has problems connecting to your newly named host. If you really need this option (chances are that you don´t) you are on your own to setup the appropriate authorisations.
Issuing <I>xhost +</I> before starting the connection would do the job, but be <B>warned</B> of any security risks that involves since everyone else is granted access to your X Server.
<P> 
Another source of trouble (note to Red Hat users): one of the pre-installed
network scripts might be playing tricks on you. Rename <CODE>/etc/ppp/ip-up</CODE>
to stop pppd from executing it automatically on every connection.
<P>
<P>
<H4><EM>kppp</EM> reports a successful connection, but Netscape just says "The server does not have a DNS entry"</H4>

<P>Try pinging another server by its IP number, e.g. <CODE>ping 195.0.254.76</CODE>. If that
works you should
<P>
<UL>
<LI> check if you provided <EM>kppp</EM> with at least one DNS address</LI>
<LI> check the contents of <CODE>/etc/host.conf</CODE>. There should be a line
saying something similar to <CODE>order hosts, bind</CODE>. The <CODE>bind</CODE>
keyword advises the resolver library to include a name server query when
performing an address lookup.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<H4>How do I make <EM>kppp</EM> send a \n or a \r?</H4>

<P>Just send an empty string such as in the following script:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
Send                                   # send an empty string
Expect      ID:                        
Send        itsme                     
Expect      word:                      
Send        forgot                    
Expect      granted                    
Send        ppp                        
                                       
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<H4><EM>kppp</EM> complains: "Can't create lock file"</H4>

<P>
<P>This means that you don't have permissions to create a lock file.
If you chose to use a lock file you must have write permissions to the
directory (typically /var/lock). This is of course no problem if you have
given <EM>kppp</EM> setuid permissions. Please read the section on 
<A HREF="kppp-3.html#lock files">lock files</A>
.
<P>

<H4>My modem makes much noise when dialling!</H4>

<P>Click on "Setup", "Modem". You can control the modem volume here in three
steps: off, medium and high. For most modems "medium" and "high" result in the
same volume. If that doesn't work, make sure that the correct settings for
your modem are specified in "Setup"/"Modem"/"Modem commands"!
<P>
<P>
<H4>I turned the modem volume "off" and verified the modem commands,but I still hear that noise when dialling!</H4>

<P>The volume initialisation string can get lost if your modem can't cope with
the speed it revives its command from <EM>kppp</EM>. Increase the value of
"Post-Init Delay" in "Setup"/"Modem"/"Modem commands"!
<P>
<P>Click on "Setup", "Modem". You can control the modem volume here in three

<P>
<P>
<H4><EM>kppp</EM> reports an unusual modem speed like 115200, 57600 or similar </H4>

<P>Many modems only report the speed of the serial line and not the speed over
the telephone line as default. You must configure these modems to report the
true line speed (add to modem init or dial string). For many modems this
command is "ATW2". If you want to add it to the dial-string (typical "ATD"), the new dial
string would be "ATW2D".
<P>
<P>
<H4><EM>kppp</EM> reports "Unknown speed"</H4>

<P>New modems often have very complex connection messages like "CONNECT
LAP.M/V42.bis/115000:RX/31200:TX", and <EM>kppp</EM> cannot parse this message
correctly. Turn on "Show Log" and you'll see the connection speed. I'm
currently working on a solution for this, and the parser is now much better,
but still not perfect.
<P>
<P>
<H4>Slow connection speed</H4>

<P>If you are not satisfied with the modem speed, make sure you've set the 
connection speed ("Setup" / "Device" / "Speed") to 57600 or higher. Make sure
that your serial ports support higher speeds. Many systems based on i486 do
not work correctly when you set the speed to 115200. If you have a 8250 UART
chip, it won't work. If you have a 16550 or 16550A it should work flawlessly.
<P>Additionally, consult your modem manual to look for init strings that enable a
high speed mode.
<P>
<P>
<H4>REALLY slow connection speed</H4>

<P>If data drips in at a rate of just a few bytes per second you should check
your hardware setup. If moving your mouse speeds up the transmission this is
definitely a hardware issue.
<P>Obtain some information about your serial port with
<CODE>setserial -a /dev/ttySx</CODE> and check for interrupt conflicts with other
components of your system.
<P>
<P>
<H4>My phone line needs pulse dialling instead of tone dialling (or vice-versa)</H4>

<P>You must modify you modem dial string. Nearly all modems support the 
following AT-commands:
<UL>
<LI>ATDT - selects tone dial</LI>
<LI>ATDP - selects pulse dial</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<P>
<H4><EM>kppp</EM> makes really strange things (whatever)</H4>

<P>Did you compile it or the libraries with gcc-2.8? This version of gcc is
somewhat broken, and it will not work as expected.
<P>
<P>
<H4>How do I write a telephone cost rules file?</H4>

<P>Just follow the TEMPLATE rules files supplied with <EM>kppp</EM>. You should be
able to find a copy in the <CODE>${KDEDIR}/share/apps/kppp/Rules</CODE>. 
Use the <CODE>-r</CODE> <EM>kppp</EM> command line options to check the syntax of your proposed
rules file.
<P>
<P>
<H4>I have written a telephone cost rules file for my region. Where can I submit it so that others can make use of it?</H4>

<P>I would love to receive any rule files written. I will make them available
on my <EM>kppp</EM> 
<A HREF="http://devel-home.kde.org/kppp/index.html">web page</A>.
Before you send me a new rules file make sure it is not already available on 
the <EM>kppp</EM> web page. Then email the new rules file one of the current
maintainers.
<P>
<P>
<H4>Can my phone cost rulefile contain fractional time units, e.g. "(0.17,45.5)"?</H4>

<P>Yes this is possible. But you should not use unusual small time units (below
tenth of a second), because this would result in higher CPU load (though I
doubt you'll notice with a modern CPU :-)
<P>
<H4>My country observes a moving holiday different from easter.</H4>

<P>In that case you need to write new code that allows for the computation of that
holiday. Please have a look at ruleset.cpp and emulate the ``easter'' example.
Then send us the patches.
<P>
<P>
<H4><EM>kppp</EM> tells me "Sorry, the modem is not ready".</H4>

<P>Uncheck the "Modem Asserts CD Line" option you will find on the Modem tab.
Your hardware seems to be missing support for sensing the "Carrier Detect"
line.
<P>
<P>
<H4>The connection fails with "Timeout expired while waiting for the PPP interface to come up!"</H4>

<P>The PPP daemon didn't get into contact with the remote server in time.
Listed below are a few hints that helped several users:
<UL>
<LI> Play with the setting of Line Termination (Device tab)</LI>
<LI> Add a "Pause 1" or "Pause 2" scripting command (even if you're using PAP
or CHAP)</LI>
<LI> Increase the pppd timeout (PPP tab)</LI>
<LI> Use the real device instead of a symbolic /dev/modem link</LI>
<LI> Toggle the "Use Lock File" setting (Device tab)</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<P>
<H4>"Sorry, the modem is busy"</H4>

<P>
<UL>
<LI> you might be an unlucky owner of a
<A HREF="kppp-3.html#winmodem">WinModem</A></LI>
<LI> did you correctly configure the serial port or internal modem ?
The interrupts might not be set up correctly.</LI>
<LI> verify that no other software is currently accessing the modem</LI>
<LI> If you're using a 2.2.5 (or newer) Linux kernel there might be a
conflict with the serial support module. See
<A HREF="http://www.suse.de/sdb/en/html/sf_seriell.html">http://www.suse.de/sdb/en/html/sf_seriell.html</A> for further details.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H4>How do I disable dial tone detection ?</H4>

<P>Put X3 into your dial string, e.g. ATX3DT.

<H4>Serial line is looped back</H4>

<P>Short answer: You haven't started the PPP software on the peer system.
<P>See a posting from Al Longyear on 
<A HREF="http://www.dejanews.com/getdoc.xp?AN=184945314">http://www.dejanews.com/getdoc.xp?AN=184945314</A> for a more detailed explanation.

<H4>Signal 15</H4>

<P>If you see the following lines you've probably just received a timeout error
from <EM>kppp</EM>, too. <EM>kppp</EM> has been waiting for the PPP interface to
come up and gave up after the specified timeout. pppd was signaled to shut
down with signal number 15, i.e. SIGTERM.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
pppd[26921]: pppd 2.3.5 started by me, uid 500
pppd[26921]: Using interface ppp0
pppd[26921]: Connect: ppp0 &lt;--> /dev/ttyS0
pppd[26921]: Terminating on signal 15.

<P>
<H4>Receive serial link is not 8-bit clean</H4>

<P>The PPP daemon is alarmed by the fact that all data it receives has bit 8 set
to zero. In most cases this simply indicates that the remote PPP server isn't
running yet. You might be still confronted with a login prompt that echoes
back all data sent by your pppd.
<P>
<P>
<H4>can't locate module ppp-compress</H4>

<P>Do you get the following messages ?
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
