<H3><A NAME="s6">6. PAP and CHAP</A></H3>

<P>
<P>Starting with version 0.9.1 <EM>kppp</EM> supports directly the most commonly used
form of PAP authentification. The section 'PAP and CHAP with <EM>kppp</EM>' will
descripe how to make PAP and CHAP work with <EM>kppp</EM> in general, while the
section 'PAP with <EM>kppp</EM>' will describe in detail how to take advantage
of <EM>kppp</EM>'s build in support for the most commonly encountered version of
PAP wich is  widely used by commercial Internet Service Providers (ISP). 
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss6.1">6.1 PAP with <EM>kppp</EM></A>
</H3>

<P>
<P>There are two different ways to use PAP:
<P>
<H4>Client side authentication</H4>

<P> 
This variant is used by many
commercial ISP´s. It basically means that you (or your computer) must
authenticate yourself to the ISP´s PPP server. The PPP server must not
authenticate himself to your computer, but typically this is not necessary
since you know which computer you are connected to (because the connection was
established by yourself). So this is no major security issue. <EM>kppp</EM> supports
this variant directly. See below for instruction how use this one.
<P>
<P>If your ISP just gives you a username and a password and tells you to use
PAP authentication you must use this variant.
<P>
<H4>Two way authentication</H4>

<P> 
Same as above, but your computer requires the
ISP PPP server to authenticate himself. In order to establish a connection, 
you must choose the authentication method <I>Script based</I>,
not <I>PAP</I>, and you will have to manually edit
<CODE>/etc/ppp/pap-secrets</CODE>. While <EM>kppp</EM> doesn't provide build in support
for this variant -- it is nevertheless easy to establish a connection
using this variant of PAP with <EM>kppp</EM>. The details are described in the
previous section 'Using PAP and CHAP with <EM>kppp</EM>'.
<P>
<P>
<H4>Preparing <EM>kppp</EM> for PAP</H4>

<P>
<OL>
<LI> Make sure that the <CODE>/etc/ppp/options</CODE> (and <CODE>~/.ppprc</CODE> if
you do have such a file) does <B>not</B> contain one of the arguments:
<UL>
<LI>+pap</LI>
<LI>-pap</LI>
<LI>papcrypt</LI>
<LI>+chap</LI>
<LI>+ua</LI>
<LI>remotename</LI>
</UL>
<P>It is very unlikely that one of those arguments is already in there, but just
to be sure.

<LI>Start <EM>kppp</EM></LI>

<LI>Choose the account you want to use PAP with and click on <I>Edit</I></LI>
<LI>Click on the <I>Dial</I> tab.</LI>
<LI>Select <I>PAP</I> in the checkbox <I>Authentication</I></LI>
<LI>If you do not want to retype the password each time you dial in, select
<I>Store password</I>. This will save the password. Make sure that nobody
other than you has access to your account, otherwise this person will have
access to your password.</LI>
<LI>That's it. Close the dialogs, type in your the username and password
your ISP supplied to you and dial.</LI>

<H3><A NAME="PAP"></A> <A NAME="ss6.2">6.2 PAP and CHAP with <EM>kppp</EM> (alternate method)</A>
</H3>

<P>The following is based on an email by 
<A HREF="mailto:kbrown@pdq.net">Keith Brown</A>
and explains how to make <EM>kppp</EM> work for a generic PAP or CHAP account. If
your ISP just gave you a user id and a password for a PAP account the odds
are that you can skip this section and that you will get by just reading the 
next one entitled 'PAP with <EM>kppp</EM>'.
<P>
<P>PAP seems a lot more complicated at first glance than it really is.
The server (the machine you are connecting to) basically tells the client
(your machine) to authenticate using PAP. The client (pppd) looks in a
specific file for an entry that contains a matching server name and client's
name for this connection, and then sends the password it finds there. That's
about it! Now, here's how to make that happen. I am assuming a pppd version
of 2.2.0 and a standard installation of configuration files under <CODE>/etc/ppp</CODE>.
<P>
<P>For the purposes of illustration, pretend that I have an Internet account
with 'glob.net', under the user name 'booger', and a password of 'foobar'.
First, I need to add all this to the file <CODE>/etc/ppp/pap-secrets </CODE>. 
The format of an entry for our purposes, is:
<P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
USERNAME  SERVERNAME   PASSWORD
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>so I add the line:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
booger  glob  foobar
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>to the file and save it. Note: I can use any name for the server I wish
as long as I use the same name in the pppd arguments, as we'll see shortly.
I have shortened it to 'glob'. This name is just used to locate the correct
password.
<P>
<P>Now, I need to set up my connection in <EM>kppp</EM>. The basics are the same
as any other connection, and I won't go into details here, except to say
that you probably want to make sure that the <CODE>/etc/ppp/options,</CODE> is empty,
and you probably don't want any login script either. Now, in the settings
dialog, at the bottom, is the pppd arguments button. This brings up a dialog
similar to the one used for editing the login script. Here we enter values that
will be sent to pppd as command line arguments, and in the case of multiple-value
arguments, we need to enter each value as a separate entry in the listbox,
in the correct order.
<P>
<P>We can put any other arguments in here we want first.
Now we need to add arguments that pppd needs to handle PAP authentication.
In this example I am going to add 'user', 'booger', 'remotename', 'glob',
in that order. The user argument tells pppd what user name to look for
in pap-secrets, and send to the server. The remotename is only used by
pppd to match the entry in the pap-secrets file, and is not sent to the
server, so once again, it can be anything I want as long as it is consistent
with the entry in the pap-secrets file.
<P>
<P>That's all there is to it. You should now be able to set up your own
connection to a server with PAP authentication. CHAP should not be much
different. See the Linux Network Administrators' Guide for chap-secrets
file format and pppd arguments used. The rest should be gravy, but...your
mileage, ah you know the rest.

</H3>

<P>
<A HREF="mailto:birchallr@aecl.ca">Richard Birchall</A> provided us with
details about how he configured kppp to connect to a NT RAS server that
required MS-CHAP authentication:
<P>Instructions on how to patch pppd and install the DES library can be found in
the 
<A HREF="http://www.xs4all.nl/~diedvdyk/PPP-NT-HOWTO/PPP-NT-HOWTO.html">PPP-NT-HOWTO</A> and in README.MSCHAP80 from the pppd package.
<P>If your NT RAS server is not a PDC (primary domain controller), it is
necessary to include the NT domain name as part of the username, separated
by a backslash.   Because the "\" character has a special meaning to pppd,
it is necessary to use "\\".   This is explained here:
