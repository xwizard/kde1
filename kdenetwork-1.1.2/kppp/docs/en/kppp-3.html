<H3><A NAME="s3">3. Setting up <EM>kppp</EM></A></H3>

<P>In order to set up <EM>kppp</EM>, start <EM>kppp</EM> and push the <CODE>Setup</CODE> button on <EM>kppp</EM>'s
main window. A new tab dialog will appear. 
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 Accounts</A>
</H3>

<P>This dialog will display the accounts you have created. You must create at least
one account.  The ``Reset Button'' will
reset the accumulated cost for the selected account to zero. Typically you 
want to press this button once a month after having consolidated your 
telephone costs.

<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>Modem Device</B><DD><P>Select the device appropriate for your
hardware. Here are some examples:
<UL>
<LI><B>/dev/ttyS0</B> - DOS or Windows users will know this as COM1, COM2 is
/dev/ttyS1 and so on. These devices are mostly used on Linux systems.</LI>
<LI><B>/dev/cua0</B> - the first serial line (COM1). COM2 would be /dev/cua1
and so on. These devices are mostly used on BSD systems, namely FreeBSD, NetBSD
and OpenBSD.</LI>
<LI><B>/dev/ttyI0</B> - under Linux, these belong to internal ISDN
cards. These devices emulate a common Hayes compatible modem. /dev/ttyI0 is for
the first, /dev/ttyI1 for the second ISDN card and so on. These devices are only
available in the Linux version</LI>
<LI><B>/dev/modem</B> - many Linux distributions make a symbolic link from
the real modem device to /dev/modem. <B>You should avoid using this
one</B>. Use /dev/ttySx (x is a digit) instead.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="winmodem"></A>
If you can't get your modem to work at all you should verify that you don't
have one of those so called <EM>WinModems</EM>. Some manufacturers leave out
some essential hardware capabilities and let the CPU do the work. At the time
of writing there are no Linux drivers to support these (mostly internal PCI)
modems since their Windows counterparts are closed-source and the technical
specifications are not freely available. The following webpage provides
additional information and has a Linux compatibility database:

<A HREF="http://www.o2.net/~gromitkc/winmodem.html">http://www.o2.net/~gromitkc/winmodem.html</A>
<P>
<DT><B>Flow Control</B><DD><P>Select from Hardware (CRTSCTS), Software (XON/XOFF) and
no flow control. The recommended setting is Hardware flow control.
<P>
<DT><B>Line Termination</B><DD><P>Choose the correct ``Enter'' character sequence for your modem.
Most modems will use ``CR/LF''. However some modems need a different setting.
If you experience trouble while running a script: Play with this parameter.
<P>
<DT><B>Connection Speed</B><DD><P>Choose from the list of connections speeds supported by
your serial port. 
<P>
<A NAME="lock files"></A>  
<DT><B>Use Lock File</B><DD><P>Activate this option if you want <EM>kppp</EM> to create a lockfile. Under Linux
the directory for such a file will be <CODE>/var/lock</CODE>.
Programs such as mgetty depend on the existence of such lock files and
<EM>kppp</EM> will not work with mgetty if the lock file is not set.
<P>
<DT><B>Modem Timeout</B><DD><P>This is the time in seconds that <EM>kppp</EM> waits for the 
``CONNECT'' response from your modem after dialing into another modem (typically a modem
of your IPS's modem pool). I recommend a setting of about 30 seconds.
</DL>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss3.3">3.3 Modem</A>
</H3>

<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>Modem Commands</B><DD><P>This will bring up a dialog which you will need
to fill with modem commands appropriate for you particular modem. If you
own a Hayes compatible modem you most likely won't need to change any of
the defaults. I encourage you however to read  about the Hayes command
in the Appendix of this documentation. The information supplied there 
should also be of help in case  you experience trouble setting up a stable 
connection with your ISP's modems.
The two settings "Pre-Init Delay" and "Post-Init Delay" might be of special
interest to if you experience any modem lock-ups. These will make <EM>kppp</EM>
pause a bit before and after sending the initialization string. The
"Pre-Init Delay" will be accompanied by sending a CR unless given a delay
interval of 0.
<P>
If you intend to use the ISDN pseudo devices (/dev/ttyIx) you should remove
the volume commands, choose ATD as dial string and specify your local phone
number with AT&amp;Ex (see "man ttyI" for further details).
<P>
<DT><B>Query Modem</B><DD><P>Pushing the Query Modem Button will induce <EM>kppp</EM> to ask
your modem to identify itself. On success your modems response will be
displayed in a dialog. This may or may not prove to be informative depending
on your modem.
<P>
<DT><B>Terminal</B><DD><P>Pushing the <CODE>Terminal</CODE> button will bring up a mini terminal.
You can use the mini terminal to test your modem and experiment with  the 
negotiation protocol for initiating a ppp connection with you ISP. You no 
longer need a terminal program such as minicom or seyon.
</DL>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss3.4">3.4 PPP</A>
</H3>

<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>pppd Timeout</B><DD><P><EM>kppp</EM> will wait this amount of time after running the script
and starting pppd for pppd to establish a valid ppp link before giving up
and killing pppd.
<P>
<DT><B>Automatic Redial on Disconnect</B><DD><P>Selecting this will have <EM>kppp</EM> try to 
reconnect in case you inadvertently got disconnected while online.
<P>
<DT><B>Show Clock on Caption</B><DD><P>This will have <EM>kppp</EM> display the time connected
on the caption of the <EM>kppp</EM> window displayed while being online.
<P>
<DT><B>Disconnect on X-server shutdown</B><DD><P>Checking this option will cause <EM>kppp</EM>
to terminate the ppp link, disconnect the modem and terminate accounting
in an orderly fashion when the X-server shuts down. This is useful if
you are prone to forget to shut down <EM>kppp</EM> on X-server exit or simply
don't want to have to worry about disconnecting your connection.
If you don't want <EM>kppp</EM> to hang up the modem on X-server exit, you should
leave this checkbox unchecked. Be aware however, that if you have accounting
enabled, and you don't want <EM>kppp</EM> to hang up on X-server exit,  you will 
have a nonterminated accounting entry in you accounting logs, when the
X-server exits and <EM>kppp</EM> terminates.
<P>
<DT><B>Minimize Window on Connect</B><DD><P><EM>kppp</EM>'s window will be minimized after a connection has been established. The elapsed connection time will be shown in the taskbar.
<P>
<DT><B>Dock into Panel on Connect</B><DD><P>If this option is chosen <EM>kppp</EM> will dock into the panel where it will be symbolized by a small animated icon. Use the left mouse button on this icon to restore <EM>kppp</EM>'s window. The right mouse button will open up a popup-menu
that offers to restore the window, show further transfer statistics or close the connection.
This option overrides <EM>Minimise Window on Connect</EM>.
