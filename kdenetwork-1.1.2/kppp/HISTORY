=====================================================

kppp 1.4 Jul 1998

Harri Porten and Mario Weilguni have taken over the further development
of kppp.



kppp 0.6 Nov 26 97:

The data savings scheme has been switched over to to the use of KConfig.
I consider kppp virtually free of any ezppp code. I challenge anyone
who doubts this to verify my claim by doing a 'diff' on the sources.


kppp 0.3 Tue Apr 22:

With exception of the data savings scheme, which will follow next, kppp 
has almost completely been rewritten.

kppp 0.2:

kppp is based in part on ezppp beta 6, Copyright 1997 Jay Painter. 
I have tried to convince Jay to contribute his ezppp to the kde project. 
Jay responded by saying that he had no time to make this program 
suitable for the kde project. He added we should not hesitate to 
modify ezppp according to our tastes and merge it with the kde project. 
So I took ezppp, reworte most of the user interface and added many 
internal changes. We hope kppp will become a useful part of the KDE project.
