There are always more contributors to a certian package than the original
author, however, the follwing names are the ones who are held mostly
responsible.  Look in the individual subdirectories for more info.

kmail is maintained by a few people.  I wish I remembered who.
knu is courtesy of Bertrand Leconte <B.Leconte@mail.dotcom.fr>.
korn is Sirtaj S. Kang's fault <taj@kde.org>.
kppp is the work of Bernd Wuebben <wuebben@kde.org>.
krn is the dirtywork of Roberto Alisina <ralisina@unl.edu.ar>.
David Faure <David.Faure@Insa-Lyon.fr> is to blame for ktalkd.
kbiff is slapped together by Kurt Granroth <granroth@kde.org>

The package is maintained by Stephan Kulow <coolo@kde.org>, nothing gets
by without his say-so.
