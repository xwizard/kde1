<body bgcolor=#ffffff>
<h1>Overview</h1>
Krn is a newsreader, oriented to support both online and offline methods
of access.<p>
It also aims at being very GUI oriented, while also maintaining easy
access to all its features through your keyboard.<p>
Obviously, it still isn't all that, so you may want to send me your feature
suggestions.<p>
