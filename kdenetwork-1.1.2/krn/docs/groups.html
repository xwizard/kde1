The groups window is the one you get first when starting Krn.<p>
Here is where you do things related to groups as a whole,
as well as manage the connection to your news server.<p>

<h4>Connecting and disconnecting to your server</h4>

<table>
<tr>
  <td>
	<img src=connected.xpm>
  </td>
  <td>
	This button connects to your server.<br>
	It is also available from the
	<i>File</i> menu<br>
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>
	<img src=disconnected.xpm>
  </td>
  <td>
	This one disconnects from your server.<br>
	It is also available from the
	<i>File</i> menu<br>
  </td>
</tr>
</table>

You may change your server's name by using the <i>Options->NNTP Options</i>
menu. Also there you can change other things like if your server needs
a username or a password.<p>
