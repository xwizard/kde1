KDE network utilities
=====================

Please, tell me on which plateforms ping needs -s as argument to
be useful... (I know there is Solaris in this case).
I know:
  solaris: needs -s
  linux: nothing

Feedback welcome!
Please send me (or http://buglist.kde.org) all bug reports.


Todo: (you can make code submissions... :-) )
=====
- in host tab, put nameservers address (from /etc/resolv.conf) to the 
	combobox
- improve/update doc
- have the host: lineedit of all tools to be a combobox
  and remember old tries



What it is?
===========
This program allows somebody to make a ping, a traceroute or a hostname
resolution without lauching a kvt.

It's a tabbed window with a big multilineedit that receive the output
of a command (ping, traceroute, host, finger, whois, ...).
