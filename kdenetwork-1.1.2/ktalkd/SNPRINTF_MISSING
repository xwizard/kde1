ktalkd needs the snprintf function, but some system don't have it (some
Solaris versions, for instance).

If snprintf is missing on your system, you can do the following :

* compile ktalkd/kotalkd/vsnprintf.c, by entering 'make vsnprintf.o' in this
directory. (there might be warnings, don't be afraid of them...)
* if it compiles
  - add vsnprintf.o to the kotalkd_OBJECTS line in ktalkd/kotalkd/Makefile 
  - copy vsnprintf.o to ktalkd/ktalkd
  - add vsnprintf.o to the cond0ktalkd_OBJECTS line in ktalkd/ktalkd/Makefile 
  then run make from the toplevel directory again.

Many thanks to Olof S Kylander <olof@frozenriver.com> for providing vsnprintf.c
and to Bert Haverkamp <b.r.j.haverkamp@its.tudelft.nl> for reporting bugs in this readme.

I know, the really good approach would be to include the missing
automatically, which can be done. But for this I need to know if
vsnprintf.c compiles on all architectures where snprintf is missing.
If yes, I'll make the code in vsnprintf included automatically (in kdecore/fakes.cpp)
