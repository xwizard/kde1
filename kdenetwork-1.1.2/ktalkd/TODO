TODO:
  - a 'not here' option, which launches the answmach at once (if set to on).
     (or refuse the talks otherwise).
    This way, when you leave, you switch 'on' the answmach.
  - insensitive case and long logins supported for user names (big problem).
  - a kdelnk file, not for launching ktalkd, but to make kdehelp's 
    helpindex find ktalkd   - how to avoid it to appear in the K menu ?

I thought also of a kde app. swallowed in kpanel, to choose options like
  "refuse talks ('not here')", "activate/desactivate answering machine" 
  to launch a talk client, and to set up forwardings.
But you can add to the panel a button to launch kcmktalkd, which does 
  all this except launch talk sessions.
