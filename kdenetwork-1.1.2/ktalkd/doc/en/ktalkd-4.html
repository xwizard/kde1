<H3><A NAME="s4">4. Usage</A></H3>

<P>
<P>To use ktalkd, you need a talk client. The text-based <CODE>talk</CODE> is available on 
most Unix systems. Try <CODE>talk your_username</CODE> to see what happens when you
receive a talk request. You can also try the answering machine the same way :
initiate a talk to yourself, ignore the announcement twice, and you'll see the
answering machine.
<P>There is a talk client with a graphical interface for the KDE, <CODE>ktalk</CODE>.
It's not yet shipped with KDE packages, but you can find it on
ftp://ftp.kde.org. It should be in
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/kde/stable/latest/apps/network">ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/kde/stable/latest/apps/network</A><P>
<P>The announcement dialog box is trivial : respond or ignore.
<P>The configuration dialog should be rather straight forward, except for setting up a
forward to another user (or even to another host).

<H3><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 Choosing a Forwarding Method</A>
</H3>

<P>None is perfect, they all have pros (+) and cons (-).
<P>
<P><B>FWA</B> : Forward announcement only. Direct connection. Not recommended.
<UL>
<LI>       (+) You know who the caller is, but</LI>
<LI>       (-) Caller will have to respond to an announcement from you. Annoying.</LI>
<LI>       (-) Don't use if you have an answering machine on your 'away' location.
(The answering machine can't popup an announcement, it would be confusing!)</LI>
</UL>
<P><B>FWR</B> : Forward all requests, changing info when necessary. Direct connection.
<UL>
<LI>       (+) Caller won't know that you're away, but</LI>
<LI>       (-) You won't really know who the caller is - only his username, 
(so you might see "talk from Wintalk@my_host")</LI>
</UL>
<P><B>FWT</B> : Forward all requests and take the talk. No direct connection.
<UL>
<LI>       (+) Same as above, but also works if you and caller can't be in
direct contact one with the other (e.g. firewall).</LI>
<LI>       (+) You'll be told who's really talking to you when you accept the talk</LI>
<LI>       (-) But as in FWR, you won't know his machine name in the announcement</LI>
</UL>
<P>In short, use <B>FWT</B> it you want to use it behind a firewall (and if ktalkd
can access both networks), and <B>FWR</B> otherwise.
