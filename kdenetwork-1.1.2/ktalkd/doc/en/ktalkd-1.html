<H3><A NAME="s1">1. Introduction</A></H3>

<P>
<P><CODE>ktalkd</CODE> is an enhanced talk daemon - a program to handle incoming talk requests,
announce them and allow you to respond to it using a talk client.
<P>GLOSSARY : In this document, if somebody wants to talk to you, you are 
designated as the "callee".
<P><CODE>ktalkd</CODE> has the following features :
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>KDE or not KDE</B><DD><P>That is the question. :) More seriously, this means that
<CODE>ktalkd</CODE> is able to be compiled with or without KDE support.
To use it without KDE, the compilation stage will detect if X or Qt 
or KDE is not installed, but you can force a non-KDE daemon if you 
use the configure option '--without-X'.
<P>
<DT><B>Answering machine</B><DD><P>If the callee isn't logged on, or doesn't answer after
the second announcement, an answering machine is launched, takes the
message, and mails it to the callee.
<P>
<DT><B>Sound</B><DD><P>If desired, a sound is played with the announcement.
<P>
<DT><B>X Announce</B><DD><P>If compiled with KDE installed, ktalkd will use
<B>ktalkdlg</B>, a KDE dialog, for announcement.
If <B>ktalk</B> is running, it will be asked to make the announcement 
itself. (New since 0.8.8).
<P>
<DT><B>Multiple displays annoucement</B><DD><P>If you are logged remotely (e.g. with an
<CODE>"export DISPLAY=..."</CODE> command), the X announcement will be made on
this display too. Answer on the one you want !
If you're also logged in a text terminal, and if you're NOT using xterms
(internal restriction), then you'll see a text announcement too, in case 
you're using the text terminal at the time of the announcement.  
<P>
<DT><B>Forwarding   <I>(New since 0.8.0)</I></B><DD><P>You can set up a forward to another user even to another host
if you're away. There are 3 different forwarding methods. See section 'Usage'.
<P>
<DT><B>Configuration</B><DD><P>If ktalkd is compiled for KDE, it reads config from KDE config files,
the sitewide ($KDEDIR/share/config/ktalkdrc) and the user one, in its home directory.
The sitewide one has to be manually edited by the administrator, but there is now
a configuration dialog for the user one. It's called <B>kcmktalkd</B> and can 
be found in the KDE Control Center after installing <CODE>ktalkd</CODE>.
On non-KDE systems, <CODE>ktalkd</CODE> will read /etc/talkd.conf.
<P>
<DT><B>Internationalization</B><DD><P>Under KDE, the announcement will be in your language provided that
you set it in the KDE menus and that someone translated <B>ktalkdlg</B> to your
language. The same goes for the configuration dialog, <B>kcmktalkd</B>.
<P>
<DT><B>Support for otalk and ntalk   <I>(New since 0.8.1)</I></B><DD><P>ktalkd now supports both protocols, even when forwarding. 
ktalk supports both protocols as well.
</DL>
<P>
<P>I hope you will enjoy this talk daemon,
