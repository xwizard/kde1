########### Edit below to set up a forward ###########

# Enable forward by uncommenting and editing this line 
#Forward: user@host

# Choose forward method :
# None is perfect, they all have pros (+) and cons (-).
#
# FWA : Forward announcement only. Direct connection. Not recommended.
#        (+) You know who is the caller, but
#        (-) Caller will have to respond to an announcement from you. Annoying.
#        (-) Don't use if you have an answering machine on your 'away' location
#  (The answering machine can't popup an announcement, it would be confusing!)
#
# FWR : Forward all requests, changing info when necessary. Direct connection.
#        (+) Caller won't know that you're away, but
#        (-) You won't really know who's the caller - only his username,
#            (so you might see "talk from Wintalk@my_host")
#
# FWT : Forward all requests and take the talk. No direct connection.
#        (+) Same as above, but works also if you and caller can't be in direct 
#            contact one with the other (e.g. firewall).
#        (+) You'll be told who's really talking to you when you accept the talk
#        (-) But as in FWR, you won't know his machine name in the announcement
#
#ForwardMethod: FWR
