<STRONG>Finger output</STRONG><BR>
To select how Kfinger have to get from finger output the values you must press "Format.."<BR>
Kfinger could read 2 Vars, with C function scanf, from finger output; the two vars
are an integer(var2) and a string(var1). You must specify a format string for scanf
and an offset for the read string (how many characters must be ignored before start 
to read).<BR>
Than you have to create a format string for the output.<BR>
<P>EXAMPLE:<BR>
I have the following output with kfinger and I want to obtain a talkLauncher list where
the username is "root" and the server is "portNNN-ISDN.InterService.com" :<BR><BR>
<PRE> Name           tty      idle<BR>

Mary             3         0<BR> 
robert           4         0<BR>
