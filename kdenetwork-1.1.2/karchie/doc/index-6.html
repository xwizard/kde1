<P>Archie was developed out of the prospero service, a service to give one a
remote directory structure. With this directory service, the archie client
looked for the queried filename. A graphical widget for X11 was developed
with xarchie. I wanted to add some usefull features like session management,
nice GUI and the use of KDE-kfm and got karchie.
Please look at the README's for further information.
I haven't written the email adresses for archie and xarchie here, because I
don't wont to bother them with my bugs.</P>
