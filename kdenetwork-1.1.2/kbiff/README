KBiff v2.3.7
Kurt Granroth <granroth@kde.org>

WHAT?
-----
KBiff is a biff utility.  It is highly configurable but very easy to
use and setup.  It tries to combine the best (or at least *all*) of
the features of most of the other "biff" programs out there.

WHY?
----
... use it at all?

   KBiff has a number of advantages over the competition
   o Pure GUI configuration.  No command line paramters or strange config
     files.  All settings for KBiff can be done from one setup dialog
   o Session management.  KBiff starts up with the same configuration you
     left it with.
   o Panel docking.  KBiff can be docked into the panel very easily.  Handy
     when you are monitoring several mailboxes and don't have the room
     anywhere else.
   o System sounds.  KBiff can play a .wav file when new mail arrives
   o Animated gifs.  KBiff can handle GIF89 animated gifs
   o mbox, maildir, mh, POP3, IMAP4, and NNTP support.
   o Highly configurable.  There are very few things in KBiff that you
     have to accept.  Most things can be changed to fit your needs.

Enjoy!
Kurt
