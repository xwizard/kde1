08-24-99 - Kurt Granroth (2.3.10a)
   o Had to split my sources again since we can only commit bug fixes during
     the freeze for KDE 1.2.  This does *not* have the internal code changes
	 from 2.3.8
   o "Launch" button should now look better i18n'ed
   o Empty Status: lines in mbox should now be flagged as read (patch from
     Dirk Foersterling)
   o KBiff should compile on HP-UX again (patch from Stefan Becker)
   o Popup no longer shows 1 new mail when there is 0 messages (patch from
     Riko Jacob)
   o KBiff should no longer dump core when restarting a session.  Don't know
     when this bug was introduced... but it's squashed now.

06-06-99 - Kurt Granroth (2.3.7)
   o Passwords with '(' in them should now work...

06-03-99 - Kurt Granroth (2.3.6)
   o POP3 protocol now exits properly when closing.  This should fix a bevy
     of irritating socket problems.

04-24-99 - Kurt Granroth (2.3.5)
   o Note to self: ALWAYS test with gcc 2.7.2 before shipping!!

04-22-99 - Kurt Granroth (2.3.4)
   o Added 'Mailer' button to notify dialog.  This will launch your mail
     client.
   o Added button to test new mail sound
   o NNTP support works again.  Not sure when it broke..

04-21-99 - Kurt Granroth (2.3.3)
   o Setup dialog is now correctly deleted (patch from Bjorn Hansson)  
   o New "not connected" icon for network protocols (patch from Bjorn Hansson)
   o Got rid of 'const' warning (patch from -- guess who -- Bjorn)
   o Async net protocols are now "25% faster" (patch from Bjorn.. again!)
   o POP3 code now closes the socket if there was an error (Bjorn)
   o Icon should now draw correctly when it is not the first app docked
     into the panel.  Seems there was a race condition (me, this time)

04-16-99 - Kurt Granroth (2.3.2)
   o Config files are now read with read only enabled.  This hopefully should
     prevent the "empty" config files bug.
   o Notify boxes will no longer take focus when they pop up

04-08-99 - Kurt Granroth (2.3.1)
   o It is now possible to have only one profile with a name other than Inbox

03-27-99 - Kurt Granroth (2.3)
   o KBiff now has NNTP support!  It is a very basic implementation, but
     it seems to work in lots of cases.
   o Should now handle Netscape Mail folders.  Netscape seems to use an
     internal (read: not in the headers) way of determining mail state...
     but using X-Mozilla-Status might work a little.
   o Some more tweaks with the asynchronous code.
   o Should now handle mbox mailboxes that double as IMAP or POP mailboxes.
     I think PINE might use this format for all of its mailboxes (maybe).

03-23-99 - Kurt Granroth (2.2.8)
   o POP3 and IMAP4 code reworked due to a incredibly well done patch from
     Bjorn Hansson <Bjorn.Hansson@signal.uu.se>.  KBiff should now work
     on laptops much better than before.  All socket connections can now
     be asynchronous AND KBiff should no longer "leak" file descriptors
   o The new mail count on the floating status should now be correct at
     all times for mbox and imap4 mailboxes.

03-09-99 - Kurt Granroth (2.2.7)
   o Fixed bone-headed bug which would cause KBiff to seg fault in a
     'leaveEvent'.  Many thanks to Scott Bender <sbender@harmony-ds.com>
     for working with me on this!
   o MH handling code no longer allocates memory without deleting it.  No
     more 64Meg KBiff processes!

03-08-99 - Kurt Granroth (2.2.6)
   o Should now compile again with gcc 2.7.2.  Also made status popup
     a little more elegant looking.

03-06-99 - Kurt Granroth (2.2.5)
   o Implemented a Frequently Asked Feature (FAF) -- KBiff will now popup
     a list of mailboxs with the newmail count when you put your mouse over
     the icon (like a tooltip).  As with pretty much everything in KBiff,
     this is configurable.

02-27-99 - Kurt Granroth (2.2.4)
   o KBiff now counts the number of new mail in MH mailboxes.  Also fixed
     a silly bug that I introduced while applying the last patch.

02-26-99 - Kurt Granroth (2.2.3)
   o KBiff now supports MH mailboxes!  Thanks to David Woodhouse
     <David.Woodhouse@mvhi.com> for the very well done patch!

02-23-99 - Kurt Granroth (2.2.2)
   o username, password, and path are now encoded.  That means that really
     funky usernames like 'granroth@kde.org' and '/users/granroth' will
     now work!

02-09-99 - Kurt Granroth (2.2.1)
   o Fixed stupid bug where I tried to print out the mailbox name from the
     notify dialog.. AFTER I deleted the dialog :-(

02-04-99 - Kurt Granroth (2.2)
   o "Notify" dialogs are now non-modal AND are controlled.  That means that
     when number of new mails changes, the number displayed is updated.  If
     the state goes to OldMail or NoMail, the dialog is destroyed.

02-01-99 - Kurt Granroth
   o Changed imap code to use 'unseen' flag instead of 'recent'
   o Slightly modified Trace.cpp code to compile on NetBSD (tip o' the hat
     to Jaromir Dolecek <jdolecek@per4mance.cz> for that).  Apparently,
     the va_start() macro on NetBSD does NOT like the (const char*)
     overloaded method for QString
   o Small change to kbiffmonitor.cpp so that pop3 doesn't produce hundreds
     of new 'notify' boxes (patch by Martin Hill <mjhill@home.com>)

01-30-99 - Kurt Granroth
   o Thanks to David Barth (dbarth@videotron.ca) for pointing out that
     older POP3 servers (ones that don't support UIDL) will cause KBiff
     to fail even though there is code to get around that...(patched)

01-13-99 - Kurt Granroth
   o Put KProcess handling code by itself so that all executing code passes
     through it.
   o Added profile name to tooltip
     
11-11-98 - Kurt Granroth
   o Added patch by Martin ? <spirk@kla.pvt.cz> to handle arguments for
     mail client better

11-10-98 - Kurt Granroth
   o Removed Qt 1.33 compatibility from CVS version and put back AUTOMOC

10-31-98 - Kurt Granroth
   o Released 1.1.6

10-26-98 - Kurt Granroth
   o Changed width of Advanced button so that certain translations will
     fit.

10-24-98 - Kurt Granroth
   o Fixed bug in POP3 code where it would *never* go back to "no mail"
     state if it ever received new mail.

10-13-98 - Kurt Granroth
   o Hideously mangled KTreeView to look exactly like QListView... at least
     as far as kbiff is concerned.  It is *very* ugly.. but it works!  And
     the cool thing is when I decide to go with QListView (the real one)
     exclusively, well, I just have to nuke ktreeview.[cpp|h] and remove
     a few #ifs.

10-10-98 - Kurt Granroth
   o Replaced QListView with KTreeView.  QListView isn't cool enough to
     require all kbiff users to upgrade to Qt 1.40.  Maybe after KDE 1.1
     is released, I'll put it back...

10-06-98 - Kurt Granroth
   o Added patch from Ian Denton to use POP3 UIDL to check number of new
     messages.  Doesn't quite work perfectly, but it's almost there!  Still
     problems with knowing when POP3 mailbox was "read", though...
     POP3 code now will attempt to figure out the number of new messages
     by checking UIDL, then if that fails, it checks STAT, then if that
     fails, it checks LIST.

10-04-98 - Kurt Granroth
   o Checking for new messages in mbox breaks the code!  Added a work-around
     that may or may not work (didn't test yet).  This will also break
     random file monitoring (file *must* be in mbox format), so I added
     a new protocol: "file"
   o Modified Trace class so that it will work with egcs.

09-25-98 - Kurt Granroth
   o Changed POP3 code back to using STAT.  Apparently some servers don't
     return the number of messages with a successful USER/PASS

09-24-98 - Kurt Granroth
   o Added code from 'korn' to check number of new messages in mbox.  'Notify'
     should not correctly list the number of new messages in all four
     mailbox types.
   o Changed 'getlogin()' to more general form.  Hopefully doesn't break on
     non-Linux systems.
   o Some bug fixes.

09-23-98 - Kurt Granroth
   o Quite a few bug fixes.

09-19-98 - Kurt Granroth
   o Added -secure option
   o Added "Read Mail" menu item.  This will set the flags to OldMail if it
     was New.  This also disables checking for new mail until the "current"
     new mail becomes old!

09-18-98 - Kurt Granroth
   o Fixed bug in 'scramble'

08-26-08 - Kurt Granroth
   o Added isGIF8x to facilitate animated gifs.
