~b~12,4             Web Server Notes                                           

Credit: Thanks to Roberto for the PWS config dialog,
99.9% of the work is his.

The web server setup is a graphical configuration
for the freely available web server called
mathopd.  It's run/controlled via kSirc and
I've some fun running it.

Couple notes to remember, you cannot use ports
< 1024.  I'm not going to run anything as root,
since running a web server is dangerous enough,
much less giving potential root access away.

/url command will show you a valid url
for you sure.  Replace <port> with the port(s)
that the web server is running on.

~b~12,4                  MDI Mode                                              

Credit: Timothy Whitfield, ported the MDI interface
from kEirc into a generic MDI interface for KDE.

Now, if you want to use it, here's a bunch of
problems I've already seen:

1. Acelerator keys are all messed up.  pgup/dn
is a good example.  It just doesn't work.

2. If you minimize something, you have to
double click on the channel name in the server
controller to bring it back.

3. You cannot minimize the server controller.

4. You can drag windows off the screen in never
never land.

I'm personally not a big fan of the MDI interface
but I'll work on making it work right as time permits.

~b~12,4                  OTHER Stuff                                           

There's been a bunch of bug fixes everywhere.

Cut & paste now cleans up correctly most of the time now.

New release notes box, I think it's usefull. What do
you think?

Caption should be more usefull now.  I think this is the
best way to display the topic on the screen.

Server controller is in and needs some more work.  Basic
idea works well though.

/help now displayes all possible functions, instead of just 
built in ones.  Shows all kSirc commands as well.
