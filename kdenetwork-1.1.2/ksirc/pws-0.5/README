| WARNING ------- WARNING |
+-------------------------+

This program installs a web server, and makes it accessible
to other users on other computers. There is always some risk of
this being a security risk. I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR IT.
So, BE CAREFUL.
DON'T USE IT AS ROOT (It shouldn't work anyway).

So, now that I scared you, keep on reading ;-)

PWS is a frontend for the incredible mathopd web server.
It is meant to be used basically as a personal web server, for example,
if you want to share pictures in a chat page, you need to give a URL
to the pic.

Well PWS and mathopd let you do that in a painless way.

Just start it, enable the server, and let it roll.

It can also be used easily to provide you with a simple web server.
In fact, the capabilities of mathopd and its low resource usage make
it an ideal solution for simple personal homepage serving, and similar
stuff.

So, if you sometime wanted to have a web server and never dared mess with
apache and it's kind... here's a chance to play ;-)

PWS is released under your choice of the Artistic license (Read the file
ARTISTIC for details) or the GPL (read file COPYING).

Mathopd is released under its own license, look in that package.

If you need any other license agreements (but I fail to see why), just ask.

For a list of the things still missing from pws, read the TODO file.

Installation Instructions
-------------------------

PWS has two pieces, the configuration/activation interface (called PWS)
and the web server itself, which is a great program called mathopd,
written by Michiel Boland <boland@diva.nl>.

So, you first need to install mathopd. One of the things that make mathopd
great is just how simple this is.

You should have here a file called mathopd-1.1.tar.gz. That's mathopd.

Untar it in the usual way (gzip -c mathopd-1.1.tar.gz |tar xvf -).

That should give you a directory called mathopd-1.1.

cd mathopd-1.1/src
./configure
make

That should create a file called mathopd. That's the server itself.
Copy it somewhere in your path (/usr/local/bin is usually a good place,
~/bin is another popular choice if you are not root).

Mathopd is now installed, and we can move to the second piece, PWS itself.

Return to the pws-0.1 directory, and then:

./configure
make
make install

And that's it, pws is now installed.

Enjoy!
