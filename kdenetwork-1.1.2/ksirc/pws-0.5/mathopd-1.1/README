   
   Mathopd is a single-threaded web server for UNIX-like systems.
   It supports persistent connections and `IP-less' virtual hosts.
   It is made with one purpose only: to be as fast and lightweight
   as possible.
   
   This is the final version of Mathopd-1.1. No more features
   will be added to this release.
