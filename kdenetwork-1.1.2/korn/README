korn 0.3
--------

An xbiff-like program to monitor multiple mailboxes.


WHAT
----

korn monitors a number of mailboxes for incoming messages and displays the
number of new letters received in the box since it was last read. 

Optionally, korn can be configured to run a shell command whenever new
mail is received (I use it to play audio) and to run a command when the
mailbox button is double clicked (I use it to pop up the mailbox). 

I know, I know, it's an awfully shabby program.

Changes since 0.2:

Swallow bugfix
Disabled position memory by default
Added --nomouse to disable mouse events (for swallowing)
Compiles cleanly with new libs

WHY
----

... did i write it? 

	Wanted something to replace "xbuffy", my previous mailbox monitor,
	with something written in Qt. Don't want Xt no more.

... is it called korn.

	dunno really. had to begin with a k. didn't want to call it "kbuffy".
	And KORN is a cool band.
