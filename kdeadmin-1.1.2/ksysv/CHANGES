* Version 0.4.99	(pputzer 17-June-99)
	- some small fixes for 1.1.2
          (this is only an interim version,
	   neither HEAD nor my development version
	   will include these modifications - 
	   most are already in place)

* Version 0.4.6		(pputzer 11-April-99)
	- removed useless "inline"
	- better NDEBUG support
	- added workaround for segfault-bug
	  (SIGSEGV-handler)

* Version 0.4.5		(pputzer 06-March-99)
	- small bugfix for Qt 1.43
	  (QFontMetrics may not be accessed outside
	  of QPainter::begin( QPaintDevice* ) anymore)
	  
* Version 0.4.4		(pputzer 31-January-99)
	- removed old and useless moc-dependencies
	  from Makefile.am
	- small cosmetic fix for pathnames with "/"
	  appended
	- service-names starting with "/" are treated
	  as absolute pathnames now => it is possible
	  to add entries for scripts that do not lie in
	  the "Services" directory

* Version 0.4.3		(pputzer 27-January-99)
	- added KURLLabel again (copied from
	  kdelibs/kdecore) - without my "personal"
	  copy of those files I always get segfaults
	  in the constructor of the "About..." dialog

* Version 0.4.2		(pputzer 14-January-99)
	- accidentally rm´ed all files
	- bumped up version number to commemorate 
	  recovery of source with "mc" (Midnight Commander)
	- (c) 1997-1999 in "About" dialog

* Version 0.4.1		(pputzer 22-December-98)
	- looks like I was a bit to quick pronouncing
	  KSysV ready... I added re-sorting after
	  the sorting number of an entry is changed
	  via the properties dialog
	- fixed paste stuff (the menu that "appends")
	- added updated documentation

* Version 0.4.0		(pputzer 20-December-98)
	- we are ready for prime-time: bumped up
	  version number

* Version 0.3.27	(pputzer 20-December-98)
	- changed license to just GPLv2 (not GPLv2 "or
	  at your option, any later version")
	- removed Kurt Granroth´s copyright from the about
	  dialog (since KURLLabel is not included with
	  ksysv anymore), added "Uses KDE libraries" and
	  "Uses Qt lib" messages.
	- replaced "(c)" with the real copyright symbol ("©")
	- removed several un-needed member variables
	- removed some more excessive "const"
	- made KSVDragData inspectors inline (they are called
	  _VERY_ often)
	- fixed HAVE_SYS_PARAM_H
	- fixed handling of cut, copy & paste (you can´t
	  select "Paste" now if nothing is the clipboard,
	  neither can you "Copy" or "Cut" when no entry
	  is selected)

* Version 0.3.26	(pputzer 19-December-98)
	- added Quickhelp (using KQuickHelp)
	- eliminated my own copy of KURLLabel
	  (and updated About dialog ´cause Text would be
	   3 pixels to high with the new version)
	- found a way to make About dialog fixed size
	  (using freeze(int,int))
	- eliminated KNumericSpinbox (replaced by QSpinBox)
	- "Available Scripts" entries can´t be modified anymore
	- made properties dialog fixed size

* Version 0.3.25	(pputzer 18-December-98)
	- fixed segfault when (supposedly) not exiting
	  the application (had to re-implement closeEvent)
	- add message handler to eliminate debug() and
	  Qt warning()s when compiling with -DNDEBUG
	- fixed behaviour of Preferences dialog
	- <Enter> and <Return> work now the same as a
	  doubleclick (calling up properties dialog)

* Version 0.3.24	(pputzer 15-December-98)
	- fixed compilation error on non-BSD boxes
	  (introduced by bieker)
	- fixed "start/stop/restart" (took me some time
	  to find that multiple-signals bug...)
	- added some i18n messages I forgot earlier

* Version 0.3.23	(pputzer 01-December-98)
	- some clean-ups (removed excessive "const")
	- only usable by root now (same KMsgBox as in
	  the user manager, but with a "Close" button
	  (I think someone said to always use "reasonable
	  labels, not M$-style "OK"/"Cancel")
	
* Version 0.3.22	(pputzer 19-November-98)
	- fixed several warnings with egcs 1.1
	- fixed bug in moc output
	- began to update documentation (in SGML again)
	- disabled printing (won´t be implemented until
	  after KDE 1.1)

* Version 0.3.21	(pputzer 18-June-98)
	- since 1.0 is getting near I have to release
	  this as soon as possible (this will be the last
	  developer-only release before 1.0)
	- modified the preference dialog a little,
	  should be cleaned up, but not before 1.0 comes
	  out...
	- fixed a memory hole in KSVTrash/ReadOnlyDragList

* Version 0.3.20	(pputzer 13-June-98)
	- finally tracked down a bug in KSVDragData
	  that prevented the correct propagation
	  of isNew()/new_entry

* Version 0.3.19	(pputzer 11-June-98)
	- tried to replace QString with
	  const char* (as a return type)...
	  couldn't get it to work right, so
	  I changed that again...
	- added a Timer for autoscrolling

* Version 0.3.18	(pputzer 09-June-98)
	- uses KURLLabel now (in About-dialog)
	  maybe use it for context-sensitive help?
	- uses KNewPanner for the log diplay now
	  (log is resizable)
	- saves panning factor now

* Version 0.3.17	(pputzer 06-June-98)
	- optimized draw() in draglist.cpp
	  (now only the neccessary "cells" get
	   repainted, don't know of any further
	   optimization to be done)
	- fixed bug in draw (I mis-used the
	  QRect(int,int,int,int) constructor)
	- fixed bug in the deletedItems list
	- renamed draglist.* to DragListCanvas.*,
	  DragList.* to DragList.* and
	  RODragList.* to ReadOnlyDragList.*

	- dumped KTypeLayout
	- uses layout-managers wherever possible

* Version 0.3.15	(pputzer 28-May-98)
	- experimented with QLayout

	- should be released soon
	- saving works now mostly

* Version 0.3.13	(pputzer 25-May-98)

	- doesn´t save settings
	  on changing path preferences anymore
	- updated the GUI (progress dialog swallowed
	  in status bar now)

* Version 0.3.11	(pputzer 11-May-98)
	- various fixes
	- implemented clearRL
	- cleaned-up code
	  (uses KSVConfig extensively now)

* Version 0.3.10	(pputzer 04-May-98)
	- fixed annoying bug in KSVDragData::toString()
	  (actually IMHO a bug in the implicit sharing
	   in QString) that caused path to become the
	  "marshalled" object-string...
	- sort numbers of "changed" items shown in red
	- generating numbers works now (execpt for empty lists...
	  (will fix that today)
	- fixed some memory leaks in drag'n'drop

	- multiple selection seems to work
	- selection is now a class (KSVSelection)

* Version 0.3.5		(pputzer 22-Mar-98)

	  dropping a script on itself.

* Version 0.2.4		(pputzer 21-Jan-98)

	  (currently based on "mouseMoveEvent" and

	   compliant)
	- several small fixes
	- changed msgtype for ipc to 3L / 4L instead
