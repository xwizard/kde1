** DESCRIPTION
ksysv lets you edit your SysV-style init configuration using drag'n'drop.

** INSTALLATION
Just do a <make && make install>.

** CONFIGURATION
Through the GUI (Options/Configure...)

** CONTACT
If something doesn't work (or does work :-) ) correctly, contact me:
  Peter Putzer, putzer@kde.org

** CAVEATS / ADDITIONAL NOTES
Make a backup of your /etc/rc.d tree before using this program.
This program needs to be set suid root to be usable from non-root accounts.
Making programs suid generally is _NOT_ a good idea, and besides
only root should fiddle with files in /etc anyway. So don't use it if you're
not root.

** LICENCE
 This program is licenced under the GNU General Public Licence, GPL for short.
