<H3><A NAME="s2">2. Onscreen Fundamentals</A></H3>

<P>Here you learn how to use ksysv, which shouldn't be hard since it was designed
to be as user-friendly as possible.
<H3><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 Mouse</A>
</H3>

<P>Using ksysv with a mouse or other pointing device is easy:
just drag an entry from the <B>"Available Services"</B> area onto
one of the six runlevels to start (or resp. stop) it in that runlevel.
<P>You can also move scripts between runlevels, or change the position in
a given runlevel, by dragging it around. Doing so removes the entry from its
original runlevel (or position). This doesn't happen when you drag an entry
from the "Available Services" area.
<P><B>Note:</B> Entries are moved when you drag them to a new area. To copy
a service to a different runlevel, you have to select "Copy" from the "Edit" or
context menu and "Paste" it in the target runlevel.
<P>The <B>sorting number</B> of an entry sometimes cannot be calculated.
In such a case you have to edit the sorting numbers of surrounding entries before
re-trying to insert the service.
<P><B>Note:</B> Sorting numbers can range from 00 to 99, but no higher.
<P>You can delete entries by dragging them onto the "Trash Can" area (symbolized by
an icon depicting a garbage bin).
<P><B>Note:</B> Currently there is <B>no</B> way to recover items dragged onto the
"Trash Can", so be careful!
<H3><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 Keyboard</A>
</H3>

<P>You can use the &lt;TAB&gt; key to switch focus between different panels ("Available
Services", "Runlevel 1 Start", "Runlevel 1 Stop", etc.) and the cursor keys to move
the selection up and down.
<P>To move an entry to a different runlevel, "Cut" it to the clipboard (using &lt;Ctrl-X&gt;,
or the key you specified in <B>Settings/Keys/Standard Keys</B>) and "Paste" it in the
target runlevel (default shortcut: &lt;Ctrl-V&gt;).
<P>To manually change an entries sorting number or name, press &lt;ENTER&gt; to open the
properties dialog. Use the &lt;TAB&gt; key to switch between different fields. Close the
dialog by pressing &lt;ENTER&gt; to accept the modifications, or press &lt;Esc&gt; to cancel
any changes.
<H3><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 The Menu Entries</A>
</H3>

<P>A one by one description of KSysV´s menu.
<H4>File</H4>

<P>Because of the danger of data loss, all menu entries under "File" ask for
confirmation before doing their work.
<P>
<P>
<P><B>New Configuration</B>: clears all changes made and re-reads the runlevels
from disk.
<P><B>Save Configuration</B>: makes your changes permanent. Saving does not generate
backup files, so use with care!
<P><B>Exit</B>: quits the program.
<H4>Edit</H4>

<P><B>Cut</B>: cuts the currently selected service to the clipboard.
<P><B>Copy</B>: same as above, but the entry is copied and not removed from its
original position.
<P><B>Paste</B>: pastes content of the clipboard at the current cursor position.
<H4>Options</H4>

<P><B>Show Tool Bar</B>: allows to switch the toolbar on and off.
<P><B>Show Status Bar</B>: same as above, but for status bar.
<P><B>Show Log</B>: enables or disables the logfile window (all operations, error
messages etc. are stored in the logfile).
<P><B>Configure...</B>: opens the configuration dialog. There you can set the paths to
the runlevels, as well as the colors used for new and modified entries.
<P><B>Save Options</B>: all of the above-mentioned settings are only valid until the next startup, unless you choose to Save Options (will also save the window geometry).
<H4>Help</H4>

<P><B>Contents</B>: opens the helpbrowser with this document.
<P><B>About ksysv...</B>: displays a dialog with KSysV´s copyright information.
<P><B>About KDE...</B>: some information about the KDE project.
