<sect>Introduction

<P>Welcome to my <bf>System V Init Editor</bf>, commonly known (and hereafter referenced)
as <bf>ksysv</bf>. This section introduces a few concepts and explains what you can
do with ksysv.</P>

<P>The following explanation is "borrowed" from <tt>tksysv</tt> (an inspiration
for ksysv):</P>

<sect1>A Brief Description of System V Init

<P>System V init is fast becoming the standard in the Linux world to control
the startup of software at boot time. This is because it is easier to use and
more powerful and flexible than the traditional BSD init.</P>

<P>I won't go into the history here (mainly because I don't know it :-).</P>

<P>The init binary is located in <tt>/sbin</tt> and not <tt>/etc</tt>. This is important as
one might try and upgrade a machine to System V init without re-installing
and reformatting. The Linux kernel looks in <tt>/etc</tt> for its init first, so you
must make sure and delete your old init from there if any.</P>

<P>SysV init also differs from BSD init in that the config files are in a
subdirectory of <tt>/etc</tt> instead of residing directly in <tt>/etc</tt>. This directory is
called <tt>rc.d</tt>. In there you will find <tt>rc.sysinit</tt> and the following directories:

<tscreen><verb>
init.d/
rc0.d/
rc1.d/
rc2.d/
rc3.d/
rc4.d/
rc5.d/
rc6.d/
</verb></tscreen>
</P>

<P><tt>init.d</tt> contains a bunch of scripts. Basically, you need one script for
each service you may need to start at boot time or when entering another runlevel.
Services include things like networking, NFS, sendmail, httpd, etc. Services
do not include things like setserial that must only be run once and then exited.
Things like that should go in <tt>rc.local</tt>.</P>

<P><tt>rc.local</tt> should be in <tt>/etc/rc.d</tt> if you want one. Most systems include one
even though it doesn't do much. You can also include an <tt>rc.serial</tt> in <tt>/etc/rc.d</tt>
if you need to do serial port specific things at boot time.</P>

<P>The chain of events is as follows: 

<itemize>
<item>the kernel looks in several places for init and runs the first one it finds
<item>init runs <tt>/etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit</tt>
<item><tt>rc.sysinit</tt> does a bunch of necessary things and then runs <tt>rc.serial</tt> (if
it exists)
<item>init runs <tt>rc.local</tt>
<item>init runs all the scripts for the default runlevel
</itemize>
</P>

<P>The default runlevel is decided in <tt>/etc/inittab</tt>. You should have a line
close to the top like: 

<tscreen><verb>
id:3:initdefault:
</verb></tscreen>
</P>

<P>From this, you'd look in the second column and see that the default runlevel
is 3, as should be the case for most systems. If you want to change it, you
can edit <tt>/etc/inittab</tt> by hand and change the 3. Be very careful when you are
messing with the inittab. If you do mess up, you can get in to fix it by rebooting
and doing:

<tscreen><verb>
LILO boot: linux single
</verb></tscreen>
</P>

<P>This *should* allow you to boot into single user mode so you can fix it.</P>

<P>Now, how does it run all the right scripts? If you do an '<tt>ls -l</tt>' on <tt>rc3.d</tt>,
you might see something like:

<tscreen><verb>
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 13 13:11 S10network -&gt; ../init.d/network 
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 16 13:11 S30syslog -&gt; ../init.d/syslog 
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 14 13:32 S40cron -&gt; ../init.d/cron
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 14 13:11 S50inet -&gt; ../init.d/inet
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 13 13:11 S60nfs -&gt; ../init.d/nfs
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 15 13:11 S70nfsfs -&gt; ../init.d/nfsfs
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 18 13:11 S75keytable -&gt; ../init.d/keytable
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 23 13:11 S80sendmail -&gt; ../init.d/sendmail.init
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 18 13:11 S90lpd -&gt; ../init.d/lpd.init
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 11 13:11 S99local -&gt; ../rc.local
</verb></tscreen>
</P>

<P>What you'll notice is that there are no real "files" in the directory.
Everything there is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory. The
links also have an "S" and a number at the beginning. The "S" means to start
this particular script and a "K" would mean to stop it. The number is just
there for ordering purposes. Init will start all the services based on the
order they appear. You can duplicate numbers, but it will only confuse you
somewhat. You just need to use a two digit number only, along with an upper
case "S" or "K" to start or stop the services you need to. </P>

<P>How does it start and stop services? Simple. Each of the scripts is written
to accept an argument which can be "start" and "stop". You can execute those
scripts by hand in fact with a command like:

<tscreen><verb>
/etc/rc.d/init.d/httpd.init stop
</verb></tscreen>
</P>

<P>to stop the httpd server. Init just reads the name and if it has a "K",
it calls the script with the "stop" argument. If it has an "S" it calls the
script with a "start" argument.</P>

<sect2>Why All These Runlevels ?

<P>Some people want an easy way to setup machines to be multi-purpose. I could
have a "server" runlevel that just runs httpd, sendmail, networking, etc. Then
I could have a "user" runlevel that runs xdm, networking, etc. </P>

<!-- Usage -->

<sect>Onscreen Fundamentals

<P>Here you learn how to use ksysv, which shouldn't be hard since it was designed
to be as user-friendly as possible.</P>

<sect1>Mouse

<P>Using ksysv with a mouse or other pointing device is easy:
just drag an entry from the <bf>"Available Services"</bf> area onto
one of the six runlevels to start (or resp. stop) it in that runlevel.</P>

<P>You can also move scripts between runlevels, or change the position in
a given runlevel, by dragging it around. Doing so removes the entry from its
original runlevel (or position). This doesn't happen when you drag an entry
from the "Available Services" area.</P>

<P>
<bf>Note:</bf> Entries are moved when you drag them to a new area. To copy
a service to a different runlevel, you have to select "Copy" from the "Edit" or
context menu and "Paste" it in the target runlevel.
</P>

<P>The <bf>sorting number</bf> of an entry sometimes cannot be calculated.
In such a case you have to edit the sorting numbers of surrounding entries before
re-trying to insert the service.</P>

<P>
<bf>Note:</bf> Sorting numbers can range from 00 to 99, but no higher.
</P>

<P>You can delete entries by dragging them onto the "Trash Can" area (symbolized by
an icon depicting a garbage bin).</P>

<P>
<bf>Note:</bf> Currently there is <bf>no</bf> way to recover items dragged onto the
"Trash Can", so be careful!
</P>

<sect1>Keyboard

<P>
You can use the &lt;TAB&gt; key to switch focus between different panels ("Available
Services", "Runlevel 1 Start", "Runlevel 1 Stop", etc.) and the cursor keys to move
the selection up and down.
</P>

<P>
To move an entry to a different runlevel, "Cut" it to the clipboard (using &lt;Ctrl-X&gt;,
or the key you specified in <bf>Settings/Keys/Standard Keys</bf>) and "Paste" it in the
target runlevel (default shortcut: &lt;Ctrl-V&gt;).
</P>

<P>To manually change an entries sorting number or name, press &lt;ENTER&gt; to open the
properties dialog. Use the &lt;TAB&gt; key to switch between different fields. Close the
dialog by pressing &lt;ENTER&gt; to accept the modifications, or press &lt;Esc&gt; to cancel
any changes.
</P>

<sect1>The Menu Entries

<P>A one by one description of KSysV´s menu.</P>

<sect2>File

<P>Because of the danger of data loss, all menu entries under "File" ask for
confirmation before doing their work.<P>

<P><bf>New Configuration</bf>: clears all changes made and re-reads the runlevels
from disk.</P>

<P><bf>Save Configuration</bf>: makes your changes permanent. Saving does not generate
backup files, so use with care!</P>

<P><bf>Exit</bf>: quits the program.</P>

<sect2>Edit
<P><bf>Cut</bf>: cuts the currently selected service to the clipboard.</P>

<P><bf>Copy</bf>: same as above, but the entry is copied and not removed from its
original position.</P>

<P><bf>Paste</bf>: pastes content of the clipboard at the current cursor position.</P>

<sect2>Options
<P><bf>Show Tool Bar</bf>: allows to switch the toolbar on and off.</P>
<P><bf>Show Status Bar</bf>: same as above, but for status bar.</P>
<P><bf>Show Log</bf>: enables or disables the logfile window (all operations, error
messages etc. are stored in the logfile).</P>

<P><bf>Configure...</bf>: opens the configuration dialog. There you can set the paths to
the runlevels, as well as the colors used for new and modified entries.</P>

<P><bf>Save Options</bf>: all of the above-mentioned settings are only valid until the next startup, unless you choose to Save Options (will also save the window geometry).</P>

<sect2>Help
<P><bf>Contents</bf>: opens the helpbrowser with this document.</P>
<P><bf>About ksysv...</bf>: displays a dialog with KSysV´s copyright information.</P>
<P><bf>About KDE...</bf>: some information about the KDE project.</P>

<sect>Configuration
<P>
All options are saved in <tt>ksysvrc</tt>. Defaults are taken from the global file, if available, or else generated within KSysV. Changes to the defaults are stored in a local ksysvrc, normally <tt>$HOME/.kde/share/config/ksysvrc</tt>.
</P>


<sect1>Recognized Sections
<P>Recognized sections and keys plus their default values.</P>

<sect>Appendix

<!-- Is there a better way to make the Q&A stuff? -->

<sect1>Questions and Answers

<sect2>Q1:<label id="q1"> "I played around with the default runlevel and now my machine reboots all the time"
<P>Enter <tt>linux single</tt> at the LILO prompt
<tscreen><verb>
LILO: linux single
</verb></tscreen>
and press &lt;ENTER&gt; to boot up in single user mode. Then edit the file
<tt>/etc/inittab</tt> and change the default runlevel to something sane
(<bf>3</bf> should usually be OK).
</P>

<sect2>Q2:<label id="q2"> "My machine "halts" just after booting"
<P>See <ref id="q1" name="question Q1"> above.</P>

<sect2>Q3:<label id="q3"> "I scheduled some services to be run in runlevel X using KSysV, but they aren´t"
<P>If you´re using <bf>SuSE</bf> or <bf>Delix</bf> (DLD) distributions:
you also have to edit a distribution-specific file in <tt>/etc</tt>. Please
have a look at the manual of your distribution for details.

<P><bf>Note:</bf>The approach to starting services used by the above-mentioned
distributions makes configuration of services easy for the proprietary config-tools
of these distributions, but unfortunately is non-standard. I´m planning to write a generic
extension for this approach some time in the future, but as I´m currently rather short
on time, don´t hold your breath for this.</P

<P>If you are using a different distribution:
Please check whether you´ve got all config files needed by the service (and whether they
are in the right directory, too). Some daemons (for example <bf>Apache</bf>, aka <tt>httpd</tt>) just die silently if their configuration files are not present or misconfigured.</P>

<sect1>Standard Semantics of Runlevels

<P>These vary by distribution, so I´ll just list them all (note that
this list is by no means comprehensive, so please send me a mail, if
you know what the different runlevels do for a distribution not included
in this list.</P>

<sect2>Red Hat

<P>
<itemize>
<item><bf>Runlevel 0:</bf> halt (shuts down the machine)
<item><bf>Runlevel 1:</bf> Single user mode (can be entered by typing ´<tt>linux single</tt>´ at the <tt>LILO: </tt> prompt)
<item><bf>Runlevel 2:</bf> Multi user text-only, without NFS
<item><bf>Runlevel 3:</bf> Multi user text-only, with full networking (this is the default runlevel)
<item><bf>Runlevel 4:</bf> Not used
<item><bf>Runlevel 5:</bf> Multi user X11, with full networking
<item><bf>Runlevel 6:</bf> reboot
</itemize>

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
 59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307, USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

                            NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
