12/07/1999: fgetpwent/getpwent/fgetgrent/getgrent issue fixed (FreeBSD have no
             fxx funcs. Thanks to Hans Petter Bieker <zerium@traad.lavvu.no>.
24/04/1999: change _KU_FIRST_USER to KU_FIRST_USER, and put a define for it into
	 globals.h  <duncan@kde.org>
24/04/1999: Bug 'Group properties did show nothing in 'Other Users' listbox.'

23/04/1999: User create and delete postpone logic implemented.
04/04/1999: Bug #1133 'new fixes dont create new user home directory anymore'
01/04/1999: Bug #895 'Kuser doesn't restore the permissions on /etc/shadow.'

19990328: added #ifdef's to kuser.cpp and kgroup.cpp so that if
	  _KU_FIRST_USER is defined to be, say, 500, then UID's and GID's
	  for regular users start at 500.  If _KU_FIRST_USER is not defined,
	  they start at 1001, the default, as before.   _KU_FIRST_USER can
	  be defined in kdeadmin/config.h.    (This is to make it easy to
	  compile kuser for compatibitlity with RedHat, where regular users
	  start at UID 500, and the User Private Group scheme is used for
	  GID's.)   <duncan@kde.org>

	  Private group mechanism implemented. Works both for
