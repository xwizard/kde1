<sect>Introduction<label id="sec-Intro">

<p>
Some time ago I had downloaded xusermgr written with XForms. This program has a
great interface but on my 800x600 display it looked very ugly. Some text labels
on the buttons were out of bounds. Of course I started to complain
about it. My friend heard me and said : "Why are you complaining? 
If you don't
like something make it better!" I thought that he was right and wrote this
primitive user manager.

<sect>Getting Started<label id="sec-Start">

<p>
This is a short introduction to Kuser. For more detailed information see
<ref id="sec-Using" name="Usage">.

<p>
Actually you do not need to do anything to begin using Kuser except
<ref id="sec-Cust" name="configuration">.

<sect>Usage<label id="sec-Using">

<sect1>Main Window<label id="sec1-MainWindow">

<p>
Kuser is a very simple application. In the main window you can see two lists:
the list of users and the list of groups. To edit a user or a group you
just double click on it. The user/group properties dialog will
appear.

<sect1>User Properties Dialog<label id="sec1-UserProps">

<p>
The user properties dialog has two, three or four tabs.

<p>
The number of tabs 
 depends on the type of the user storage system and quota presence.
Additional tabs will appear if you have shadow passwords, or any other similar
things such as /etc/master.passwd in BSD flavor Unices.

<sect2>User Info Tab<label id="sec2-userinfo">
<p>
In the 'User Info' tab you can modify: Full name, Login shell (the list of login
shells is taken from the /etc/shells file), Home directory, Extra info, User
ID, and
Password.

<sect2>Extended Info Tab<label id="sec2-extended">
<p>
The 'Extended Info' tab will appear if you have shadow passwords, or any other similar
things such as /etc/master.passwd in BSD flavor Unices.
In the 'Extended Info' tab you can modify parameters related to extended account control: Date until
change allowed, Date before change required, Date user will be warned about
expiration, Date before account inactivation, Date when account expires, and
Class (on BSD systems).

<sect2>Quota Tab<label id="sec2-quota">
<p>
You may see the 'Quota' tab only if you have at least one mounted volume with
quota enabled and a quota file present. There you may modify all quota related
parameters: File Soft Quota, File Hard Quota, File Time Limit (Grace Period),
iNode Soft Quota, iNode Hard Quota, iNode Time Limit (Grace Period). All
this parameters can be changed for each filesystem that has user quota
enabled. Filesystems can be changed using the 'Quota Filesystem' combobox.

<sect2>Groups Tab<label id="sec2-group">
<p>
The 'Groups' tab contains all the information about user's participation in groups.
First of all, it shows the user's primary group. Also, you can assign as many
 secondary groups as you wish using the arrow buttons.

<sect1>Group Properties<label id="sec1-GroupProps">
<p>
The Group properties dialog has two list boxes. The right one contains users,
who are included in the group, and the left one contains the list of
all other users in the system.

<sect1>Adding Users/Groups<label id="sec1-add">
<p>
Also you can add and delete users using either buttons or the menu.

<sect>Customizing Kuser<label id="sec-Cust">

<sect1>Edit user creation defaults<label id="sec1-defaults">

<p>
To edit the user creation defaults you can use the 'Edit defaults' dialog, which
is accessible via the menu <tt/File->Preferences/. There you may change the
defaults that are
used when creating a new user: Shell, Home Directory (or home directories
volume). Also, you can chose whether to make a home directory on 'create' or
not, to copy a
skeleton <!-- Is it the correct word for it? May be "default configuration
files"?-->
to the home directory or not. You can also enable  'User Private Group' 
 mechanism, which creates a new  personal group with the creation of a new
user, and removes the personal group when the user is removed.
