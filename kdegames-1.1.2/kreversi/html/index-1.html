<P>Reversi is a simple strategy game that is played by two players. 
There is only one type of piece - one side of it is black, the other white. If a player captures 
a piece on the board, that piece is turned and belongs to that player. The winner is the person 
that has more pieces of his own color on the board and if there are no more moves
possible.

</H3>

<P>A move consists of "outflanking" your opponent's disc(s), then flipping the 
outflanked disc(s) to your color.
<P>To outflank means to place a disc on the board so that your opponent's row (or rows) of 
disc(s) is bordered at each end by a disc of your color.
