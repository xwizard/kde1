<sect>Introduction
<p>
This program is a clone of the well known game Tetris. You must fit the
falling pieces to form full lines. You can rotate and translate the falling
piece. The game ends when no more piece can fall ie when your incomplete lines
reach the top of the board.

Every time you have destroyed 10 lines, you gain a level and the pieces fall
quicker (exactly the piece falls from a line each <tt>1/(1+level)</tt> second).

<sect>How to play
<p>

<sect1>Handling the falling piece
<p>

This game use keyboard keys to rotate, translate or drop down the falling
piece. This keys are configurable with the menu item <tt>options->keys</tt>.

<sect1>How to gain points
<p>

There are two sources of points :
<itemize>
<item> Dropping down a piece gives a small amount of points equals to its
drop height. It is not much but better than one can think perticularly in
small levels (when the pieces fall slowly).

<item> The biggest part of the score comes from destroying full lines. It is
very important to note that destroying multiple lines at the same time 
gives you much more points. A four-lines destruction is called a
<em>tetris</em> : it gives a maximum amount of points.
<p>
The points gained are 40 for a one-liner, 100 for two lines, 300 for three
lines and 1200 for a tetris. These numbers must be multiplied by the current
level. Destroying four lines in level 10 gives 12000 points !!

</itemize>


<sect>Multiplayer
<p>

The multiplayer option is in the <bf>alpha stage</bf> (it is been heavily
reworked), so expect it to be buggy. You can play with 2 or more players.

Basically when destroying a line, a player sends debris at the bottom of the
game of his next opponent.
