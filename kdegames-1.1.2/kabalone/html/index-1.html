<P>Abalone is a simple board strategy game that is played by two players. There are red and 
yellow pieces for each player. Beginning from a start position where 
each player has 14 pieces, moves are drawn till one player has pushed 6 pieces of his 
opponent out of the board.
<P>The original program was developed in 1993 for DOS and pure Xlib. For KDE there was a major rewrite.
<P><B>Notice</B>: The game idea is not by me. It is a real board game vendored by a 
German game producing firm (I believe).
