<UL>
<LI>Red always moves first. </LI>
<LI>Two types of moves are allowed:
<UL>
<LI>Normal<BR>
One, two or three pieces of yours in a row can be moved be one in the 6 directions. 
Side moves are also allowed.
<P>Press the left mouse button on the first piece you want to move.
The piece will then be highlighted. Now drag the mouse to the desired position.
If the move is valid, the cursor will change to an arrow in that direction and all
the pieces of the move will be highlighted. If this is the move you want to draw
release the mouse button. 
<P>Side moves are handled another way: For two adjacent pieces click between 
them and drag; for three pieces press the middle mouse button on the middle piece - 
if a side move is allowed for the pieces they will be highlighted. 
Otherwise only the middle one is highlighted and you draw a normal move. <BR>
</LI>
<LI>Pushing<BR>
You can push a maximum of two pieces of the opponent in front of your own pieces as 
long as the number of the drawn pieces of yours is greater than that of the opponent 
pieces. That means with three own pieces you can push one or two of the opponent and 
with two pieces one. 
<P>Special pushing moves are those which push a piece of the opponent out of the board. 
If you have drawn 6 of those moves you have won. 
<P>If you still do not know what kabalone is all about, look at a game where the computer plays 
both sides. After executing kabalone, select Options/Computer plays/Both and start a new game.
