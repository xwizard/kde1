<LI><CODE>Save Position</CODE> -
You can save the actual position and retrieve it later with Restore position. 
Positions are saved even after quitting the program.</LI>
<LI><CODE>Stop Search</CODE> -
When the computer is thinking, his depth search is interrupted and he 
draws the best move he has found so far.</LI>
<LI><CODE>Take Back</CODE> -
Take back your previous move. Two (!) moves are undone: the opponents move and your last move. 
So it's your turn again. 100 moves are remembered; so don't hesitate to take 
back moves until you are at the beginning of the game (faster with the F2 key).</LI>
<LI><CODE>Hint</CODE> -
A hint for your next move is shown. Only possible if you play at level normal or above, 
the move number is 2 or greater and you do not undone your move. </LI>

<LI><CODE>Level</CODE> -

moves he searching in advance to calculate the best move. You can interrupt the search by 
pressing the S key. </LI>
<LI><CODE>Computer Plays</CODE> -
You can make the computer play Red, Yellow or both sides. Choose between these options 
before starting a new game. Of course it works in a game too if you want to change sides.</LI>
<LI><CODE>Moving Slow</CODE> -
A move drawn by the computer normally (when this option is checked) is shown by 
blinking and highlighting of the pieces used in this move. Uncheck this option if you don't 
want to wait for this animation: Then only a quick highlighting is done. </LI>
<LI><CODE>Spy</CODE> -
If option Spy is checked: If it is your turn, you can see the 
computer's rating of the move you want to play in the status bar. If it's the 
computer's turn you can see (in status bar and hightlighted pieces) the move he actually 
thinks is the best to play. Of course this changes along his search.</LI>
<LI><CODE>Save</CODE> -
Save options in the application's config file. Options are restored at the start of kabalone.
