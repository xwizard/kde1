Version 0.5

- fixed a problem with the recognition of straights (the combo ace-2-3-4-5 was
  not recognized in all versions <0.4.1

  not find any new ones :)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.4.1

Silly me deleted some important lines that were initializing a timer while
merging my version of 0.4 with the one in the CVS. This caused 0.4 to
segfault when you press "Draw Cards" :-(

- [Robert William] put version.h back in.

- integrated version.h so that there is only one #define for the version & 
  release date (and not multiple ones like before)

- put epilogue into the documentation

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.4

- deleted version.h because it is of no use
- put in that nice "wave" effect
- added sm-support
- some internal stuff (as usual :)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
