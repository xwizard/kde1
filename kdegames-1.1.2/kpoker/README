This is release 0.5 of KPoker, a simple video poker clone for the 
KDE desktop environment <http://www.kde.org>. 

This is an cvs-only release and therefore you can only get it with the game
package from  <http://www.kde.org>

This version is considered to be stable. Please take a look at the file 
CHANGES to see what was changed recently.

Have fun with the game and please report any problems / bugs suggestions.
