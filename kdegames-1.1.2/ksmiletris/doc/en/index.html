KSmiletris User Manual</H1>
<IMG SRC="ksmiletris.gif" HEIGHT=531 WIDTH=370>

<P>KSmiletris is a Tetris-like game written for the K Desktop Environment
using the QT and KDE libraries. It has been tested under the Beta 4 release
of KDE and should be considered stable.

<P>I release it under an <I>open source code</I> license. If you like this
program, send me a postcard from your hometown <B>:-)</B>.

How to play</H1>
The only keys you need to use are the four arrow keys plus the space bar.
The objective of the game is to control and to place the falling blocks,
so that two blocks vertically have matching patterns. This sequence and
the blocks behind are then removed, and the above blocks will fall down.
<H1>
Where to find the sources</H1>
The main FTP site is <A HREF="ftp://ftp.vix.com/guests/ssigala/pub/">ftp.vix.com</A>,
where you can find the latest sources of this program plus the sources
of other programs written by me. The other available FTP site is KDE main
site <A HREF="ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/kde/">ftp.kde.org</A>, or any other
mirror.

To Do</H1>

<UL>
<LI>
The KDE audio interface is inadequate for complex sound applications like
games. Need to find a best method for playing sounds.</LI>

<LI>
Make the High Score board global, not local (this requires making the score
data globally writable).</LI>

<LI>
Add keys redefinition support.</LI>

<LI>
Comment the source code with <B>kdoc</B>.</LI>

<LI>
Rewrite this documentation with the KDE SGML tools.</LI>
