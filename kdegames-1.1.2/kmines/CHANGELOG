1.0.1
 * bug fix (when paused a game can be continued by changing desktops or 
   iconifying/deiconifying without time consumption ...) -- thanx to 
   François-Xavier Duranceau & ...
 * add printing facility (well it seems hacky to me and certainly not perfect
   but it works ...)
   -- thanx for Tomislav Marsic which has suggested this feature.

1.0.0
 * final cleanup before 1.0 !

0.6.12
 * use QLayout for "custom level dialog" and "highscore dialog"
 * some cleanup
 * and a fix ! (yes there was a bug still lurking : when only two
   uncovered cases remain, it was possible to win on clicking on the mine)

0.6.11
 * Added kapp->getHelpMenu() & setCaption() [Robert Williams]

0.6.10
 * included in the CVS tree

0.6.9
 * bugfix from Anders Widell (doesn't allow anymore to middle click on a flag)

0.6.8
 * some polishing (game over message do not overwrite mines number & marked 
   mines stay marked even when the game is lost : so you can completely analyse
   why you have lost :) -- thanx to Christoph Rummel for pointing these to me.

0.6.7
 * internationalization

0.6.6
 * no more NULLs (for the sake of 64bits)
 * nicer dialog boxes

0.6.4
 * adapted to libkdecore 0.7
 * hide/show menubar and popup
 * more compliant to the Style Guide
 
0.6.3

 * updating of Makefile (use KDEDIR)
 * use kmsgbox
 
0.62
 * use KKeyCode to manage some keyboard shortcuts

0.6
 * change the class name "Status" to "KStatus" as an include file present on my
   system defines something called "Status"...

0.5
 * use KApp for configuration and highscoring save (via KConfig)
 * better look of option & highscores windows

0.4
 * minor bug fix
 * 4 spaces tabs indentation
 * slight change in the "pause code"

0.3
 * the random configuration seems to be a bit too repetitive ...
   (fixed : silly me !)
 * a red cross must show where the marked cases have not contained mines
 * uncover case on button release, not on button push and also allow moving
   the mouse with the left button pressed
 * clear function with the mid*button : it should be kool :)
 * a pause entry in the menu
 * QLCD for timer and mines left
 * cleaning of the highscore stuff (the highscore file is now in the home dir)
 * option : "'?' mark" on/off (the default behaviour is on : you can change
   it by editing the defines.h file)

0.2
 * some code reorganisation
 * timer starts at first click now
 * it is no more possible to click on a marked or uncertain case now
 * a small help
 * colored pixmaps
 * a better look (?)
