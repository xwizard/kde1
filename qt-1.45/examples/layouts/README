These examples show how to make widgets that automatically lay out
their children. There are four classes:

 QtHBox		lays out its children horizontally.
 QtVBox		lays out its children vertically.
 QtButtonRow	lays out its children horizontally, giving them equal size.
 QtLabelled	draws a labelled frame around its child.

You can use these widgets in your programs without restrictions.

Widgets similar to these may or may not be part of later versions of the
Qt library.
