This example is a Qt program that only uses tool classes and does not need
an X server or X client library to run.

The example demonstrates the how to use the QDir class to traverse and
create directories, how to use QFileInfo to get information about files
and directories, how to use a QFile and a QDataStream to read and write
files, and how to use QDateTime to read the current time and date.

The createTimeStamp() function tries to cd into the directory "time.qt" under
the home directory. If it does not exist it tries to create one. The time
stamp in the file "stamp.qt" is read, if possible, and the current date and
time is then written into the file, if possible.
