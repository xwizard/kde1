<h1 align=center>Qt-based LiveConnect Plugins for Netscape and Explorer</h1>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
The Qt-based Netscape Plugin software makes it easy to write
plugins
such that they can be used on both Unix/Linux and Windows/95/NT,
in the Netscape and MS-Explorer, and any other
WWW browser supporting the same protocol.
<p>
<h2>How-to</h2>
<p>
<ol>
 <li>Download the
    <a href=http://home.netscape.com/comprod/development_partners/plugin_api/index.html>
    Plugin SDK from Netscape</a>, and copy the following files from there to
    <tt>$QTDIR/extensions/nsplugin/src</tt> :
    <multicol cols=2>
    <ul>
        <li>common/npwin.cpp
        <li>common/npunix.c
        <li>include/npapi.h
        <li>include/npupp.h
        <li>include/jri.h
        <li>include/jri_md.h
        <li>include/jritypes.h
    </ul>
    </multicol>
 <li>Build the Netscape Plugin extension library, found in the
        <tt>extensions/nsplugin/src</tt> directory of your Qt distribution.
        This produces a static library to be linked with your plugin code.
 <li>Read the <a href=annotated.html>plugin class documentation</a>, and
        examine the <a href=examples.html>example plugins</a>.
 <li>Do most of your development as a stand-alone Qt application - debugging
        Netscape Plugins is cumbersome.  You may want to use <tt>signal(2)</tt>
        in your plugin to enable core-dumps if your browser disables them.
 <li>Note the platform-specific build steps below.
 <li>Read about the raw plugin interface
        <a href=http://developer.netscape.com/library/documentation/communicator/plugin/index.htm>
        in Netscape's handbook.</a>
 <li>If files viewed by a plugin are provided by an HTTP server
        (using a <tt>http://...</tt> URL) then
        the server must be configured to send the correct MIME type
        for the file, such as by editing the <tt>mime.types</tt> file
        of Apache.  If the files are viewed via a <tt>file://...</tt>
        URL, then the browser will use the filename extension to decide
        the file type (and hence the plugin to load) - the user may need
        to set the filename extension in the Helpers or Applications
        section of their browser preferences.
</ol>
<p>
We are working on streamlining the build process for Qt-based Netscape Plugins.
<p>
<h3>Building under X11</h3>
<p>
<ul>
 <li>The Makefiles in the examples are appropriate for UNIX/X11.
 <li>The user must install the resulting Shared Object in the Plugins
        directory of the browser.
</ul>
<p>
<h3>Building under Windows</h3>
<p>
<ul>
 <li>Plugins must be named <tt>np</tt><i>name</i><tt>.dll</tt>,
     or the browser will ignore them.
 <li>The link step must include:
    <ul>
        <li><tt>/def:</tt><i>name</i><tt>.def</tt>
        <li><tt>/dll</tt>
        <li>a compiled resource file defining the
                file/MIME types accepted by the plugin.
    </ul>
 <li>The user must install the resulting DLL in the Plugins directory
        of the browser.
</ul>
<p>
<h2>Known Bugs</h2>
<p>
The Qt-based LiveConnect Plugin binding code has a number of
minor bugs, but is sufficiently stable for most production applications.
All of these have known solutions which we are working to implement.
<p>
<ul>
 <li> MSIE 4.0 support is poor.
 <li> Crashes on X11 if window is closed via window manager.
 <li> Keyboard problems on Windows.
</ul>
