<h1 align=center>Books about GUI</h1><br clear="all">
<p>This is not a comprehensive list of books, there are many other
books worth buying.  This is just a few GUI/UI books that don't gather
dust in our shelves.
<p><b>The (Psychology|Design) of Everyday Things</b> by Donald Norman,
ISBN 0-38526774-6, is one of the classics of human interface design.
Norman shows how badly something as simple as a kitchen stove can be
designed, and everyone should read it who will design a dialog box,
write an error message, or design just about anything else humans are
supposed to use.
<p>The title of the first edition was <em>The Psychology of Everyday
Things</em>, the book was renamed to <em>The Design of Everyday
Things</em> for the second edition, sacrificing a neat acronym for a
descriptive title.

<p><a name="fowler"></a><b>GUI Design Handbook</b> by Susan Fowler,
ISBN 0-07-059274-8, is an alphabetical dictionary of widgets and other
user interface elements, with comprehensive coverage of each.  Each
chapter covers one widget or other element, contains the most
important recommendation from the Macintosh, Windows and Motif style
guides, notes about common problems, comparison with other widgets
that can serve some of the same roles as this one, etc.
<p>There is an <a href="http://fast-consulting.com/chkbox.htm">example
chapter</a> on the author's web site.

<p><b>Macintosh Human Interface Guidelines</b>, second edition, ISBN
0-201-62216-5, is worth buying for the <em>don't</em>s alone.  Even
though you're not writing Macintosh software, avoiding most of what it
advises against will produce more easily comprehensible software.
Doing what it tells you to <em>do</em> helps, too.

on the web</a> and there is a

OS 8 addendum.</a>
<p><b>The Windows Interface Guidelines for Software Design</b>, ISBN
1-55615-679-0, is perhaps the best guide to how a modern GUI program
should look.  Skips some of the more elementary stuff from the
Macintosh one, but covers newer widgets (like tool tips) and says much
about e.g. dialog layout.

This book too is available on the web, but has occasionally been
hidden in an impenetrable maze of javascript.

<p><b>The Icon Book</b> by William Horton, ISBN 0-471-59900-X, is a
thorough beginner's icon drawing book.  It starts from scratch and
goes through (I assume) every aspect of icon design.  Some 500
examples are scattered throughout the text, generally in groups of
four or five.
