/*! \example aclock/aclock.cpp

  <h1 align=center>Analog Clock</h1><br clear="all">

  This example displays an analog clock widget.

  <hr>

  \include aclock/aclock.h

*/


/*! \example biff/biff.cpp

  <h1 align=center>Biff (UNIX only)</h1><br clear="all">

  Biff is a simple graphical program to indicate whether there is new
  mail; it looks exactly like xbiff but is much shorter.

  The example is divided into two .cpp files and one .h file.
  main.cpp looks like most simple Qt-based main() implementations:

  \include biff/main.cpp

  biff.h is the declaratin for the custom widget which does all the
  work:

  \include biff/biff.h

  Finally, biff.cpp implements this custom widget.  Note in particular
  how two images (hasmail_bmp_data and nomail_bmp_data, both from
  bmp.cpp) are included into the executable.

/*! \example connect/connect.cpp

  <h1 align=center>Connect the Points</h1><br clear="all">

  This example shows very simple mouse-based user interaction and
  painting without any world transform matrix or other advanced
  features.  Run the program, click the button, move the mouse,
  release the button, and watch the lines get drawn.
*/


/*! \example cursor/cursor.cpp

  <h1 align=center>Cursors</h1><br clear="all">

  This example shows how to set a mouse cursor for a widget.
*/


/*! \example dclock/dclock.cpp

  <h1 align=center>Digital Clock</h1><br clear="all">

  This example displays a digital LCD clock and can switch between time
  and date.

  <hr>

  \include dclock/dclock.h

*/


/*! \example desktop/desktop.cpp

  <h1 align=center>Painting on the Desktop</h1><br clear="all">

  The desktop demo contains three routines, each of which draws
  something on the desktop.  It does some nice stuff with QPainter,
  and also demonstrates how one can treat the desktop as a widget like
  any other.
*/	


/*! \example drawdemo/drawdemo.cpp

  <h1 align=center>Draw Demo</h1><br clear="all">

  This example demontrates several drawing functions and printer output.
  You can easily add you own drawing functions.  See "ourDrawFunctions".
*/


/*! \example forever/forever.cpp

  <h1 align=center>A Rectangle Draw "Benchmark"</h1><br clear="all">

  This example continuously draws rectangles in a window and
  has another widget that counts the number of rectangles that
  are drawn per second.
*/


/*! \example hello/hello.cpp
  <h1 align=center>Hello, World</h1><br clear="all">

  This example brings up the words "Hello, World" moving up and down,
  and in different colors.

  <hr>

  \include hello/hello.h

*/


/*! \example layout/layout.cpp

  <h1 align=center>Geometry management</h1><br clear="all">

  This example shows simple and intermediate use of Qt's layout
  classes, QGridLaout, QBoxLayout etc.
*/


/*! \example life/life.cpp

  <h1 align=center>Conway's Game of Life</h1><br clear="all">

  We'll include just the main widget from Life; there are also a
  rudimentary main() and a dialog which wraps this widget in a QSlider
  to set the speed as well as Pause and Quit buttons.

.  The class definition:

  \include life/life.h

  And the implementation of the member functions:
*/	


/*! \example menu/menu.cpp

  <h1 align=center>Using menus</h1><br clear="all">

  This example demontrates simple use of menus (a menu bar and
  pull-down menus).  Qt also supports popup menus, but this example
  doesn't contain any.
*/


/*! \example movies/main.cpp  

  <h1 align=center>Movies<br>Or the Story of the Animated GIF file</h1><br clear="all">

  The Movies example displays animated GIF files using the QMovie and
  QLabel classes.
*/


/*! \example picture/picture.cpp
  <h1 align=center>Picture</h1><br clear="all">

  This example shows how to make, store to file, and read a picture as
  a set of drawing commands.

*/


/*! \example pref/pref.cpp

  <h1 align=center>Preferences</h1><br clear="all">

  This example displays a simple (and ugly) tab dialog and then
  options the user chooses.  It illustrates hello-world usage of
  QTabDialog, QGridLayout and QBoxLayout.
*/


/*! \example progress/progress.cpp

  <h1 align=center>Progress Bar and Dialog Example</h1><br clear="all">

  This example displays either a simple (text-only) or a
  custom-labelled (user-supplied widget) progress dialog.  It also
  demonstrates simple use of menus.
*/


/*! \example qmag/qmag.cpp

<h1 align=center>QMag</h1><br clear="all">

This is a simple magnifier-type program.  It shows how one can do
some quite low-level operations portably using Qt.

Run it, click in the magnifier window, then click where you want to
magnify or drag out a rectangle.  Two combo boxes let you select
amplification and refresh frequency, a text label tells you the color
of the pixel the cursor is on, and a button lets you save the
magnified area as a .bmp file. */


/*! \example showimg/showimg.cpp

  <h1 align=center>Show Image</h1><br clear="all">

  This example reads and displays an image in any supported image
  format (GIF, BMP, PPM, XMP etc.)
*/


/*! \example table/table.cpp

  <h1 align=center>Table</h1><br clear="all">

  The table program displays a spreadsheet-like table. It is an example of
  how to inherit the QTableView widget for presentations of 2D data arrays.

  Left-click the mouse to set a current cell. Press the arrow buttons to
  move the current mark around.
*/


/*! \example tictac/tictac.cpp

  <h1 align=center>Tic Tac Toe</h1><br clear="all">

  This is an implementation of the Tic-tac-toe game.

  We didn't put much effort in making a clever algorithm so it's not a
  challenge to play against the computer. Instead, study the source code
  to see how you can make reusable components such as the TicTacGameBoard
  widget.

  <hr>

  \include tictac/tictac.h

*/


/*! \example tooltip/tooltip.cpp

  <h1 align=center>Advanced use of tool tips</h1><br clear="all">

  This example widget demonstrates how to use tool tips for static and
  dynamic regions within a widget.

  It displays two blue and one red rectangle.  The blue ones move every
  time you click on them, the red one is static.  There are dynamic
  tool tips on the blue rectangles and a static tool tip on the red one.
*/


/*! \example widgets/widgets.cpp

  <h1 align=center>Widgets Demo</h1><br clear="all">

  This example creates a window with many Qt widgets and two custom
  example widgets; aclock and dclock.

  It also shows how to connect widget signals to internal slots.
*/


/*! \example xform/xform.cpp

  <h1 align=center>Transformed Graphics Demo</h1><br clear="all">

  arbitrarily.

/*! \example application/application.cpp

  <h1 align=center>A Complete Application Window</h1><br clear="all">

  This example program looks like a complete modern application.  It
  has a menu bar, it has a tool bar, it has a status bar.

  It also illustrates use of QPrinter.  Oh yes, and you can edit text
  with it.
*/


/*! \example dirview/dirview.cpp

  <h1 align=center>A Directory Browser</h1><br clear="all">

  This example program demonstrates how to use QListView and
  QListViewItem to build a multi-column hierarchical, memory- and
  CPU-efficient directory browser.

  Here is the header file:

  \include dirview/dirview.h

  And here is the main implementation file.  Note the way the program
  scans subdirectories only when it has to.  This allows the program
  to handle very large file systems efficiently.  The same technique
  can be used in any other trees.
