<title>Qt Official Easter Egg</title>
<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="60"; URL="easteregg2.html">
</head><body bgcolor="#ffffff">

<center><h1>Congratulations!<br>
You've found our easter egg</h1><br clear="all">
<p><small>No prizes, though</small>
</center>

<p>A friend of mine forwarded the following little snippet to me,
probably because of my views on pretty pictures versus actual content.
It probably originates on USENET somewhere, but I don't know where.
<blockquote>
<p>
It sounds like there may be a near-term need for a new
newsgroup in the alt.recovery heirarchy.
<p>
"Hi, my name is Geoff and I was a N*tscapeaholic."
<p>
"Hi, Geoff."
<p>
"It started as a little Under Construction picture, then I found
myself using graphics for horizontal rules and bullets.  The next
thing I knew, I had GIF's for all of my text and my pages took
longer to download than to read.
<p>
"A guy I knew at work tried to get me hooked on PDF.  I saw the
power, and I was ready to make the switch.
<p>
"That's when a close friend of mine stepped in.  She erased
N*tscape from my hard drive and made me use Lynx.  Thanks to her,
I'm here today and I'm ready to walk the long road back to
content delivery."
</blockquote>
Amen!

<title>Books about GUI</title>
</head><body bgcolor="#ffffff">

<h1 align=center>Books about GUI</h1><br clear="all">

<p>This is not a comprehensive list of books, there are many other
books worth buying.  This is just a few GUI/UI books that don't gather
dust in our shelves.

<p><b>The (Psychology|Design) of Everyday Things</b> by Donald Norman,
ISBN 0-38526774-6, is one of the classics of human interface design.
Norman shows how badly something as simple as a kitchen stove can be
designed, and everyone should read it who will design a dialog box,
write an error message, or design just about anything else humans are
supposed to use.

<p>The title of the first edition was <em>The Psychology of Everyday
Things</em>, the book was renamed to <em>The Design of Everyday
Things</em> for the second edition, sacrificing a neat acronym for a
descriptive title.
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0385267746/trolltech/t">
(Read more or buy it.)</a>

<p><a name="fowler"></a><b>GUI Design Handbook</b> by Susan Fowler,
ISBN 0-07-059274-8, is an alphabetical dictionary of widgets and other
user interface elements, with comprehensive coverage of each.  Each
chapter covers one widget or other element, contains the most
important recommendation from the Macintosh, Windows and Motif style
guides, notes about common problems, comparison with other widgets
that can serve some of the same roles as this one, etc.

<p>There is an <a href="http://fast-consulting.com/chkbox.htm">example
chapter</a> on the author's web site.
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0070592748/trolltech/t">
(Read more or buy it.)</a>

<p><b>Macintosh Human Interface Guidelines</b>, second edition, ISBN
0-201-62216-5, is worth buying for the <em>don't</em>s alone.  Even
though you're not writing Macintosh software, avoiding most of what it
advises against will produce more easily comprehensible software.
Doing what it tells you to <em>do</em> helps, too.
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201622165/trolltech/t">
(Read more or buy it.)</a>

This book is now available
<a href="http://developer.apple.com/techpubs/mac/HIGuidelines/HIGuidelines-2.html">
on the web</a> and there is a
<a href="http://developer.apple.com/techpubs/mac/HIGOS8Guide/thig-2.html">Mac
OS 8 addendum.</a>

<p><b>The Windows Interface Guidelines for Software Design</b>, ISBN
1-55615-679-0, is perhaps the best guide to how a modern GUI program
should look.  Skips some of the more elementary stuff from the
Macintosh one, but covers newer widgets (like tool tips) and says much
about e.g. dialog layout.
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1556156790/trolltech/t">
(Read more or buy it.)</a>

This book too is available on the web, but has occasionally been
hidden in an impenetrable maze of javascript.
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/win32dev/uiguide/">Try and see.</a>

<p><b>The Icon Book</b> by William Horton, ISBN 0-471-59900-X, is a
thorough beginner's icon drawing book.  It starts from scratch and
goes through (I assume) every aspect of icon design.  Some 500
examples are scattered throughout the text, generally in groups of
four or five.
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/047159900X/trolltech/t">
