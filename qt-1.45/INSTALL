			  INSTALLING QT FOR X11


You may need to be root, depending on the permissions of the directories
you choose to install Qt in.


1.  Unpack the archive, unless you already have:

	cd /usr/local
	gunzip qt-1.44.tar.gz	# uncompress the archive
	tar xf qt-1.44.tar	# unpack it

    This creates the directory /usr/local/qt-1.44 containing the
    files from the main archive.

    Rename qt-1.44 to qt (or make a symlink):

	mv qt-1.44 qt

    The rest of this file assumes that Qt is installed in /usr/local/qt.


2.  Set some environment variables in the file .profile (or .login,
    depending on your shell) in your home directory. (Create the
    file if it is not there already.)

	QTDIR			- wherever you installed Qt
	PATH			- to locate the moc program
	MANPATH 		- to access the Qt man pages
	LD_LIBRARY_PATH		- for the shared Qt library

    If you're using GNU g++, you may also want to set these:

	LIBRARY_PATH		- contains library file path
	CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH	- contains C++ include file path

    This is done like this:
    In .profile (in case your shell if bash, ksh, zsh or sh):

	QTDIR=/usr/local/qt
	PATH=$QTDIR/bin:$PATH
	if [ $MANPATH ]
	then
		MANPATH=$QTDIR/man:$MANPATH
	else
		MANPATH=$QTDIR/man
	fi
	if [ $LD_LIBRARY_PATH ]
	then
		LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$QTDIR/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
	else
		LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$QTDIR/lib
	fi
	LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
	if [ $CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH ]
	then 
		CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=$QTDIR/include:$CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH
	else
		CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=$QTDIR/include
	fi
 
	export QTDIR PATH MANPATH LD_LIBRARY_PATH LIBRARY_PATH
	export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH

    In .login (in case your shell is csh or tcsh):

	if ( ! $?QTDIR ) then
	    setenv QTDIR /usr/local/qt
	endif
	if ( $?PATH ) then
	    setenv PATH $QTDIR/bin:$PATH
	else
	    setenv PATH $QTDIR/bin
	endif
	if ( $?MANPATH ) then
	    setenv MANPATH $QTDIR/man:$MANPATH
	else
	    setenv MANPATH $QTDIR/man
	endif
	if ( $?LD_LIBRARY_PATH ) then
	    setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH $QTDIR/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
	else
	    setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH $QTDIR/lib
	endif
	if ( ! $?LIBRARY_PATH ) then
	    setenv LIBRARY_PATH $LD_LIBRARY_PATH
	endif
	if ( $?CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH ) then
	    setenv CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH $QTDIR/include:$CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH
	else
	    setenv CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH $QTDIR/include
	endif


3.  Compile the Qt library, the example programs and the tutorial.

    The qt directory contains a Makefile which compiles everything
    (including the examples and the tutorial) for all platforms.

    Type:

	make

    You'll see a long list of platform/compiler/library combinations,
    for example "linux-g++-shared" and "solaris-cc-static".
    We recommend that you build a shared library. Applications linked
    with shared libraries get much smaller than those linked with
    static libraries.

    To choose a shared library for Linux, using the G++ compiler:

	make linux-g++-shared

    To create the library and compile all examples and the tutorial:

	make

    If your platform or compiler is not listed, read PORTING.  If it
    is listed but you have problems, see http://www.troll.no/platforms/


4.  In very few cases you may need to run /sbin/ldconfig or something
    similar at this point if you are using shared libraries.

    If you have problems running the example programs, e.g. messages like 

	 can't load library 'libqt.so.1'  

    you probably need to put a reference to the qt library in a
    configuration file and run /sbin/ldconfig as root on your system.
    And don't forget to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH as explained in 2) above.


5.  The online HTML documentation is installed in /usr/local/qt/html/
    The main page is /usr/local/qt/html/index.html
    The man pages are installed in /usr/local/qt/man/


That's all.  Qt is now installed.
