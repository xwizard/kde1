Here are the programs in the Qt tutorial.  The tutorial itself is in
../html/tutorial.html (or http://www.troll.no/qt/tutorial.html).

You can also get it on paper, see http://www.troll.no/postscript.html.

Saying just 'make' in this directory builds all the programs (t1/t1,
t2/t2, t3/t3 and so on).  Saying 'make' in each subdirectory builds
just that tutorial program.

Feel free to send comments about the tutorial to qt-bugs@troll.no.
