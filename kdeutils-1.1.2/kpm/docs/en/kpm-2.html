<H3><A NAME="s2">2. The menu</A></H3>

<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 Window menu</A>
</H3>

<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>Iconify</B><DD><P>Iconifies the main window. When iconfied, kpm uses far less CPU time because
there is no need to update the process list. If you use KWM as window manager
and the option "Dock into kpanel" is checked, you will see a little icon in
kpanel displaying the average system load. Under other window managers like
fvwm, kpm's icon itself will show the load (but this depends on how the window
manager is configured).
<P>
<DT><B>Quit</B><DD><P>Exits kpm (closing the main window has the same effect).
</DL>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 Process menu</A>
</H3>

<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>Renice</B><DD><P>Allows you to modify the priority of the marked process
(or all marked processes). Under Linux a process has a priority (nice
value) ranging from -20 (best) to +20 (worst), thus
<I>increasing</I> the nice value gives a process <I>less</I> CPU
time. You are not allowed to lower the nice value (improve its
priority) unless are the super-user. This means that, as an ordinary
user, you cannot lower the nice value of a process even if you raised
it before.
<P>Of course you are only allowed to alter the priority of your own
processes. The super-user is allowed to modify the priority for any
process, and he may lower the priority.
<P>
<DT><B>Change scheduling</B><DD><P>This option is only available to root.
The  Change Scheduling...  dialog allows the super-user to
change the scheduling policy  of  the  selected  processes
(using  the  Posix.1b  real-time extensions present in the
Linux  2.0.x  kernels).  Normal  processes  are   set   to
SCHED_OTHER  and  have static priority 0; (soft) real-time
processes have the policy SCHED_FIFO  or  SCHED_RR  and  a
static   priority   in   the   range  of  1  to  99.
<P>
<DT><B>Socket info</B><DD><P>Displays a list of TCP and UDP sockets used by the selected processes.
</DL>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 Signal menu</A>
</H3>

<P>The signal menu allows you to send various signals to all marked processes. Be
careful when doing this, especially if more than one process is marked. The
standard Linux signals are explained 
<A HREF="kpm-4.html#UNIX Signals">here</A>.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss2.4">2.4 View menu</A>
</H3>

<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>Refresh process list</B><DD><P>Immediatly updates the process list. This is very useful if you use rather
long update periods. You can also do this by pressing the update button in the
toolbar or by pressing the Space key. 
<P>
<DT><B>All processes</B><DD><P>Displays all processes.
<P>
<DT><B>Your processes</B><DD><P>Display your processes, including those running under a
different user (i.e. SETUID root programs you started)
<P>
<DT><B>Non-root processes</B><DD><P>Display all processes except those started by root.
<P>
<DT><B>Running processes</B><DD><P>Show only running processes (running or on the run queue)
<P>
<DT><B>User fields</B><DD><P>The process list will show the most interesting process fields. This are those
fields typically displayed by "top".
<P>
<DT><B>Job fields</B><DD><P>Displays most relevant fields for job-control.
<P>
<DT><B>Memory fields</B><DD><P>Shows information about memory usage, page faults...
