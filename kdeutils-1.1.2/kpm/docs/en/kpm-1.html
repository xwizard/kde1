<H3><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 What is kpm?</A>
</H3>

<P>kpm allows you to view and modify the processes of you Linux computer. It
shows detailed information of running processes, computer resources like RAM,
swap space, CPU utilization, uptime and so on. You can kill processes and modify
their priority. If you are running it as super-user, it gives you abilty to
change scheduling settings too.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss1.2">1.2 Legal stuff</A>
</H3>

<P>kpm is heavily based on 
<A HREF="mailto:f91-men@nada.kth.se">Mattias Engdegård's</A>
<CODE>qps</CODE>. The main difference between kpm and qps is the KDE interface. kpm
adheres to most KDE standard, uses the KDE config files and has session
managment. Some features of qps were removed (i.e. the ability to display Mac
OS7 style tables or special checkbox widgets). 
<P>qps (and thus kpm) is published under the GNU General Public License (GNU GPL).

<H3><A NAME="ss1.3">1.3 Requirements for kpm</A>
</H3>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>A Linux 2.0 or higher operating system. kpm makes excessive use of
Linux's <CODE>/proc</CODE> filesystem. Unfortunatly this is not portable to other
systems, because every UNIX system seems to have it's own way of gathering
process information.</LI>
<LI>K Desktop Environment Beta2 or better</LI>
<LI>Qt 1.31. Because KDE is based on Qt, this is no problem.</LI>
<LI>Your Linux kernel must be compiled with <CODE>proc</CODE> filesystem
support. Since many things like top won't even work without that, this is
standard for most kernels.</LI>
