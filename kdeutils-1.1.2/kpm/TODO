TODO:
* finish the SGML help, write a (at least) a german help
* optional feature: query the user before killing a process
* the infobar and the table only works for fonts up to 14 points. Bad.
* docking an icon in the panel (loadavg)
* the table widget behaves different than most users expect: if an title item
  is clicked, the sorting is immidiatly modified. It should be modified when
  releasing the button
* allow to choose the colors of the loadavg graph

DONE:
