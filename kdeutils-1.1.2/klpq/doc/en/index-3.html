<P>klpq [ [-n ] [-P printer ] file1 file2 URL1 URL2]
<P>On first startup klpq asks you which print spooler you use. Klpq supports
BSD, PPR and LPRng. If you don't know which spooler is installed on your
system you will most probably have BSD. If klpq does not display your printqueue
try one of the other settings (You may change the spooling system from
<EM>config->spooler</EM>).
<P>Without any arguments klpq searches for the environment variable PRINTER
and tries to display the contents of the corresponding queue. If PRINTER
is not set, it displays the contents of the queue named 'lp'. If no queue
with this name exists it displays the first printer queue in your printcap
file.
<P>With the file argument you may use klpq as a replacement for lpr. You
don't have to type <EM>lpr file_to_print; klpq</EM> but may type directly <EM>klpq
file_to_print</EM>. Klpq executes lpr for you. The -P option specifies the
spool area to use. Currently no other options to lpr are supported.
<P>The -n option tells klpq not to display the queue if a filename was
given on the command line. E.g. <EM>klpq -n file_to_print</EM> lets klpq send
the file to the printer and exit immediatly. <EM>klpq -n</EM> without file argument
will start klpq as normal.
<P>Klpq now supports URLs as arguments on the command line. Klpq will use
KFM to copy the file to a temporary file on the local system and sends
it to the printer. Please note that klpq must be running during the download.
If you quit klpq earlier the files will not be printed.
<P>DRAG&amp;DROP: You may drag any URL out of KFM and drop it on the klpq-window.
Klpq will copy the URL to a temporary file and send it to the printer.
<P>Klpq is quite easy to use, so I just want to say some words about things that
are not obvious:
<P>If the <EM>Auto</EM> button is pressed down, klpq rereads the current printqueue
every 'no' seconds, so you don't have to hit the <EM>Update</EM> button every time.
You may change the 'no' of seconds by selecting <EM>config->Auto update</EM>
from the menu. If you set 'no' to 0, then the <EM>Auto</EM> button will be completely
disabled.
<P>If you get the message <EM>This is a privileged command</EM>, than you have
to be root or any other privileged user to execute this command and if
you try to remove a printjob of another user, this is silently ignored.
<P>There are several key accelerators defined:
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Key_U</B>: like pressing the 'Update' button.</LI>
<LI><B>Key_R</B>: like pressing the 'Remove' button.</LI>
<LI><B>Key_T</B>: like pressing the 'Make Top' button.</LI>
<LI><B>Key_A</B>: like pressing the 'Auto' button.</LI>
<LI><B>Key_Left</B>: displays the previous queue.</LI>
<LI><B>Key_Right</B>: displays the next queue.</LI>
</UL>
