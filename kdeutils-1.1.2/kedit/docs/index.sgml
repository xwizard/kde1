<sect>Introduction

<p>
KEdit is the default text editor for the KDE Desktop. It is a small editor best used
in conjunction with kfm for text and configuration file browsing. KEdit may also serve
well for composition of small plain text documents. It is not meant
to be a programmers editor, in particular it is not meant to replace any of the
more powerful editors such as XEmacs or Emacs. KEdit's functionality will intentionally
remain rather limited to ensure that KEdit will start  up reasonably fast.

<sect1>New<p>
<itemize>
<item>Word-wrap works now ( hopefully ;-) )
<item>Emacs like kill-ring implemented Ctrl-k Ctrl-y
<item>Paragraph formatting Ctrl-j. Use this in conjunction with
AutoIndent and this feature becomes quite powerfull.
</itemize>

<P>
I hope you will enjoy this editor,

<sect>Installation
<p>
<sect1>How to obtain KEdit
<p>
KEdit is a core application of the KDE project <url url="http://www.kde.org">.
KEdit can be found on <url url="ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/kde/">, the main ftp site
of the KDE project.

<sect1>Requirements
<p>
In order to successfully compile KEdit, you need the latest versions of <tt> libkdecore</tt>
and <tt> libkfm</tt>. All required libraries as well as KEdit itself can be found
on <url url="ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/kde/">. 



<sect1>Compilation and installation
<p>

In order to compile and install KEdit on your system, type the following in the base 
directory of the KEdit distribution:
<tscreen><verb>
% ./configure
% make
% make install
</verb></tscreen>


Since KEdit uses <tt>autoconf</tt> you should have not trouble compiling it.
Should you run into problems please report them to the <sf/KDE/ mailing lists.

<sect>Onscreen Fundamentals
<p>

KEdit is very simply to use. I am sure that if you have ever used a text edit you 
will have no problems with KEdit. 

<p>
<sect1>Drag and Drop
<p>
KEdit makes use of the KDE Drag and Drop protocol. This means that you can darg
and drop files form the Desktop or kfm or some remote ftp site that you have
open in one of kfm's windows on to KEdit. 

<sect1>Editing files on the internet
<p>
You can open and save files transparently on the internet. Try the the following at the
command-line prompt to see an example of this.

<tscreen><verb>
% kedit ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/kde/Welcome.msg
</verb></tscreen>


<sect1> Printing
<p>
KEdit supports printing. You can either print the document your are editing
or the selection you made directly to your default printer. Optionally you can
specify the printing command of your choice. There exist a number of
printing utilities in the Unix world  which are excellent. It would
make little sense to try reimplement their efforts. Explicitely let me
mention to you the following two printing utilites.
<p>

<descrip>
<tag/GNU enscript./ Markku Rossi has written a powerful reincarnation
of Adobe's enscript ascii to postscript utility. My favorite usage is
enscript -2rG text.txt, but GNU enscript goes far beyond that. Make
sure you have the latest version from <url
url="http://www.hut.fi/~mtr/genscript/">, or any GNU mirror.

<tag/a2ps/ Akim Demaille and Miguel Santana have written a powerful
ascii to Postscript conversion utility which will format your output
depending on the documentype. Whether you want to print out C++
sources or a email message, the default styles are very nice. Get
it from:
<url url="http://www-inf.enst.fr/~demaille/a2ps.html">
</descrip>
<p>
The above two utilities are an absolute must. If you don't have them,
get them and become familiar with their usage. Learning how to use
them is no longer a problem due to our great html/texinfo/man viewer
<tt>kdehelp</tt>. These utilities are your friends when it comes to printing
in the UNIX world. Due to their power and many options once you know how to use 
them properly, you will always miss them should they ever not be available 
to you, even under Windows95.
<p>

Make sure your system is set up for printing PostScript documents. If you
don't have a native PostScript printer ( who does?) get yourself
ghostscript/ghostview version 4.03 or higher  from
<url url="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/%7Eghost/">. Note, that there are now
commercial grade ps fonts available that come with the ghostview/ghostscript
package. These fonts are a must for any quality printing of Postscript documents
on a non-postscript printer. If you were dissapointed by the results you got
from ghostscript on your printer so far - get the new fonts, this
will give you the best possible results.
