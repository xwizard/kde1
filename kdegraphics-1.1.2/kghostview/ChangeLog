  * [Duncan Haldane] <duncan@kde.org>  Fixed bug #712; 
	changed KPSWidget::layout() to KSPWidget::KPSLayout( Bool force )
	to allow forcing an image update by calling KPSLayout( True )
	for changes like Landscape<-> Seascape orientation which do not 
	change the image size. The name layout() is changed to KPSLayout() 
	to avoid confusion with QT's layout() function.  May 23, 1999.  
	Fix essentially follows suggestion by submitter of Bug report:
        Sven Fischer <herpes@kawo2.rwth.aachen.de>
