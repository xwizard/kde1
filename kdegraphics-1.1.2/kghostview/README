KGHOSTVIEW 0.7 - Beta release

This is Tim Theisen's Ghostview program ported to the K
Desktop Environment. Ghostview is used to view PostScript
documents on Unix X11 systems. It requires Alladin
Ghostcript to actually perform rendering. KGhostview also
uses the Qt toolkit.

REQUIREMENTS

1. Alladin ghostscript
2. Qt 1.3+

INSTALL

1.   ./configure
2. make
3. make install

If Ghostview works for you then so should KGhostview.
However, all VMS support has been removed and it has only
been tested on Linux.

For printer support on SYSV, SVR4 and USG systems go into print setup and set
the spool command to "lp", the printer name to your desired printer
( eg. "lp0" ) and the environment variable name to "LPDEST".
