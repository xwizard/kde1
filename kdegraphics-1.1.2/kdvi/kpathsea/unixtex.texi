@end iftex
is @url{ftp://ftp.tug.org/tex/unixtex.ftp}, last updated 18 March 1998.
Also available as @url{http://www.tug.org/unixtex.ftp}.  The IP address
is currently @code{[158.121.106.10]}, and the canonical host name is
currently @samp{tug.org}.  It is also in Kpathsea source distributions
as @file{etc/unixtex.ftp} (although the network version is usually
newer).  Mail @email{kb@@mail.tug.org} with comments or questions.

Following are general instructions for Unix or other sites who wish to
acquire the Web2c distribution, (plain) @TeX{}, La@TeX{} (2e),
Bib@TeX{}, Metafont, MetaPost, DVI processors for the X window system,
PostScript, the PCL language in the HP LaserJet, and related programs.
They are oriented towards building from the original sources, though
some information on alternative packages is included in the last
section.  See also @url{http://www.tug.org/web2c}, the Web2c and
Kpathsea home page.

Please consider joining the @TeX{} Users Group (TUG) to help support the
maintenance and development of the programs you retrieve.  Email
@email{office@@tug.org} or see @url{http://www.tug.org} for information and
a membership form.

For actual installation instructions after obtaining the necessary
sources, see @ref{Installation}.  A copy is in the distribution file
@file{kpathsea/INSTALL}.

@cindex CTAN, defined
@cindex backbone of CTAN
In many places we refer to @var{CTAN:}.  This is @emph{both} a host name
and a directory name.  Here are some primary locations:

@example
@url{ftp://ctan.tug.org/tex-archive}    @r{(California, USA)}
@url{ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive}    @r{(Germany)}
@url{ftp://ftp.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive}   @r{(England)}

@cindex mirrors, FTP
CTAN has many mirrors worldwide; see the top-level file
@file{README.mirrors} from one of the sites above, or finger
@email{ctan@@ftp.tug.org}, or see @url{http://www.tug.org/CTAN.sites}.
A list current as of the time of distribution is in the top-level file
@file{./MIRROR}.

@cindex World Wide Web CTAN access
@cindex Gopher CTAN access
@cindex email CTAN access
@cindex NFS CTAN access
You can also access CTAN via the World Wide Web, Gopher, electronic
mail, or NFS.  The same @file{README.mirrors} file explains how.

@cindex binary mode, for file transfers
You will need to retrieve some or all of the following archives,
depending on your needs (don't forget to set binary mode for file
transfers):

@table @asis
@item @file{@var{CTAN:}/systems/web2c/texmflib.tar.gz}
A basic collection of fonts (TFM files only) and macro packages
(including Texinfo and La@TeX{} 2e).  It unpacks into @file{texmf/}; if
you change the structure of this hierarchy, you will also have to change
the default search paths (@pxref{Changing search paths}).  It is
required unless you already have these files, in which case you should
change the default paths as necessary to find them.

@item @file{@var{CTAN:}/systems/web2c/web.tar.gz}

The original WEB source files, written mostly by Don Knuth.  Required
unless you already have this @file{web} version.  (The WEB sources

@file{ftp.tug.org}.  You can retrieve these distributions (but not much
else) from the @file{tex/} directory on that host.

@cindex Northwest Computing Support Center
@flindex unixtex@@u.washington.edu
@cindex support organization
You can obtain a complete @TeX{} distribution, including Web2c, on tape.

Pierre MacKay / Denny Hall, Mail Stop DH-10 / Department of Classics
University of Washington / Seattle, WA 98195 / USA

At this writing, the distribution is available in @code{tar} format on
4@dmn{mm} DAT cartridges, and the
cost is US$210.  Make checks payable to the University of Washington,
drawn on a U.S. bank.  Purchase orders are acceptable, but they carry an
extra charge of $10 to pay for invoice processing.  Overseas sites,
please add $20 for shipment via air parcel post, or $30 for shipment via
courier.

@node Other TeX packages
@subsection Other @TeX{} packages

@cindex other @TeX{} distributions
@cindex @TeX{} distributions besides Web2c

@cindex Amiga @TeX{} implementations
@cindex Acorn @TeX{} implementations
@cindex VMS @TeX{} implementations
@cindex Macintosh @TeX{} implementations
@cindex DOS @TeX{} implementations
@cindex Windows @TeX{} implementations
Many other @TeX{} implementations are available in
@file{@var{CTAN:}/systems}, including ready-to-run distributions for
Unix, Amiga, Acorn, VMS, Macintosh, DOS, and Windows (in various forms).
Although Web2c has support in the source code for many operating
systems, and in fact some of the other distributions are based on it,
it's unlikely to work as distributed on anything but Unix.  (Please
contribute improvements!)

@cindex te@TeX{}
@cindex precompiled Unix binaries
The Unix distribution alluded to above is the te@TeX{} distribution.
This includes both complete sources and precompiled binaries for many
popular Unix variants, including Linux. It is based on Web2c, and
contains many other @TeX{}-related programs as well.

@flindex labrea.stanford.edu
@cindex Knuth, Donald E., archive of programs by
The host @t{labrea.stanford.edu} is the original source for the files
for which Donald Knuth is directly responsible: @file{tex.web},
@file{plain.tex}, etc. However, unless you want to build your @TeX{}
library tree ab initio, it is more reliable and less work to retrieve
these files as part of the above packages. In any case, @t{labrea} is
not the canonical source for anything except what was created by
Stanford @TeX{} project, so do not rely on all the files available at
that ftp site being up-to-date.
