TODO list of Kfract 0.1.2
=========================

  o Some source clean-ups. Well, rather a whole re-design!!!!!!!
  o Colour cycling.
  o Better error control in file handling. 
  o A statusbar? Undecided what for.
  o Usage of 'long double' on systems which support it.
  o Save of pictures as GIFs (but not with giflib23)!!!!!
  o While pointing into a mandelbrot set switching to the
    corresponding julia set. But how? Already all mouse buttons in
    use. And Ctrl-LMB is urgh.
  o And of course: more types/formulas of fractals.
