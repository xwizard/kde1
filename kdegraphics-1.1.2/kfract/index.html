Kfract is a generator for fractals. Well, at this early stage it's only capable of mandelbrot 
sets and julia sets. Nothing fancy like Xfractint. And it's way far from being as fast as 
Xfractint. But it's much easier to use.

<P>
The code is a mess and reflects my stage of learning Qt und KDE. But it works. ;-)

<H3>1 Mouse functions</H1>
<H4>1.1 Left mouse button</H2>
Left mouse button let you draw a rectangle which will become the next picture. The
center of the rectangle will be the center of the new picture. X/Y ratio will be adapted
to fit into the window.
<H4>1.2 Middle mouse button</H2>
Middle mouse button zooms in.
<H4>1.3 Right mouse button</H2>
Right mouse button zooms out by.


<H3>2 Menu</H1>
<H4>2.1 File</H2>
<H5>2.1.1 Load params</H5>
Loads a by KFract generated parameter file and calculates the picture.
<H5>2.1.2 Save params</H5>
Saves the parameters of the current pictures. This file can be loaded later in order to
re-calculate the picture. It consists of plain ASCII and can be exchanged emong
different machines of even different architectures as long as KDE is installed.
<H5>2.1.3 Save pic</H5>
Saves current picture as BMP. Sorry, no GIF support so far.
<H5>2.1.4 Quit</H5>
Well, here you leave Kfract.


<H4>2.2 Types</H4>
Each entry switches to the displayed fractal type. So far implemented:
<H5>2.2.1 Mandelbrot</H5>
Switches to mandelbrot set. Parameters (like maximal iteration depth, co-ordinates, width,...) can
be set.
<H5>2.2.2 Julia</H5>
Switches to julia set. Parameters (like maximal iteration depth, co-ordinates, width,...) can be
set.


<H4>2.3 Options</H4>
<H5>2.3.1  Max. iteration</H5>
Maximal iteration depth can be set.
<H5>2.3.2 Colour scheme</H5>
Here you switch between 2 different colour schemes.
<H5>2.3.3 Colour cycling</H5>
Not implemented yet.
<H5>2.3.4 Zoom factor</H5>
The factors for zoom in and zoom out can be set.

<H4>2.4 Help</H4>
<H5>2.4.1 Help</H5>
Shows this help page. ;-)
<H5>2.4.2 About</H5>
Pops up an info box with some information about this program and it's
author.



<H3>3 Toolbar</H3>
<H4>3.1 Open</H4>
Like <EM>File->Load params</EM>.
<H4>3.2 Save as parameter file</H4>
Like <EM>File->Save params</EM>.
<H4>3.3 Save picture</H4>
Like <EM>File->Save pic</EM>
<H4>3.4 Zoom in</H4>
Zooms in like middle mouse button (MMB) except that the center of the actual picture becomes
the center of the new picture.
<H4>3.5 Zoom out</H4>
Zooms out like right mouse button (RMB) except that the center of the actual picture becomes
the center of the new picture.
<H4>3.6 Home</H4>
Sets all relevant parameters of the actual type to its defaults and re-calculates the set. Parameters
which are not relevant to the actual type (like colour scheme) stay untouched. If you've got lost here
you'll find back.
