Kfract version 0.1.2
====================

This is the very first public version of Kfract. It's not the fastest
fractale generator but fast enough on my DEC Alpha 500 ;-) and even
reasonably fast on my 486-66. For now it's capable of Mandelbrot sets
only.

Don't look into sources, please! This is my first Qt/KDE program. The
sources reflect my early stage in lerning Qt and KDE. Writing this
little piece of software was exactly meant for learning. If anybody
wants do take it over, please, don't hesitate to do so. On the other
hand: maybe I'll develop it a bit further.

For missing features look into TODO. For known bugs in BUGS.

Enjoy!
