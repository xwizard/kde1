<P>
I've made further internal changes in this release to make kpaint much cleaner
internally, though this process is not complete yet. You can save files
properly (at last) setting the file types is no longer a problem, note though
that I'm still using the Qt filedialog so the globs don't work right. I've
also added network file access both load and save should work, but I still
need to give visual feedback etc.
<UL>
<LI>Load and Save now work properly (though there's no jpeg write support)
<LI>You can set the file types
<LI>Added a status bar
<LI>Fixed last window closed problem
<LI>Swanky new icon thanks to Nico Schirwing (nico.schirwing@bigfoot.com)
<LI>Network file access
