Plans for KPaint
================

This file is an outline of my long term plans for kpaint, I make no promises
I'll ever do them so don't ask about release dates. At the moment I think
it's much more important to worry about completing the basics, but wouldn't
it be nice if...

I'd like to make the tools from kpaint into a kpart which would let them be
embedded in any application that wanted to do drawing. I think this is the
way forward and it's very much in the UNIX philosophy of cooperating small
tools. I'm going to have a go at this now that Torben has released the parts
code, but it's not going to be ready for general use any time soon.

I've been thinking about combining bitmap graphics with vector graphics so
that you can, for example, adjust shapes after you've drawn them. This looks
quite interesting so I may have a go.

I still think they're good ideas, but I haven't got any further with them yet.
