Help wanted: 
============

Much of my work was done "in vitro". Now it is time to go out into
the wilderness and test KFax:

I need people to send me faxes from all sorts of programs and machines 
in order to thoroughly test KFax and develop further ideas as to what needs 
to be implemented. If you own a fax modem or a fax machine and you would 
like to help, please write to me by email. I will then give you my phone 
number and we will agree on which fax program I will used for reception. 
You can then send me a fax from your favorite program or machine, stating
what machine/program you used, from where you sent the fax, what
the size of the fax is, the number of pages you transmitted etc. 
This would be very helpful. Thanks for your coorporation.

thanks,
