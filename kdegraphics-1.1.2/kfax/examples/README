This directory contains a number of fax files which you can use to
test and play with KFax:

kde.g3     a group 3 raw fax file
kde.g32d   a group 3, 2-dim raw fax file
kde.g4     a group 4 raw fax file

Note: the g32d and g4 raw fax files will not display correctly
      unless you change the default raw fax file format on the
      Fax Options dialog.

kdefaq.tiff.g3  a tiff group 3 encoded fax file
kdefaq.tiff.g32d  a tiff group 3, 2-dim, encoded fax file
kdefaq.tiff.g4  a tiff group 4 encoded fax file

Note that the tiff file format is the superiour format. Each
of the above tiff fax files contains several pages.
