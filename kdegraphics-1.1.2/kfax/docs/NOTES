kfax can display all fax output modes of ghostscript:
raw: fag3 faxg32d faxg4  
tiff: tiffg3 tiffg32d tiffg4

By default raw fax files are interpreted as g3 files. If you want
to display faxg3-2d and faxg4 files you have to specifiy this on
the command line and in the case of raw g4 files also specify
the height in scan lines of the fax if it differs from the 
default 2155.

A raw file will have no pagignation information and will be displayed
as a whole in the fax window. 
tiff files contain pagination information can be paged through in the
fax window

kfax can not display image file formats which are not related to 
faxing, such as an arbitrary tiff or gif file.


How to create fax file that sendfax /mgetty can accept and send:
gs -sDEVICE=faxg3 -sOutputFile=/tmp/fax.g3.%d yourdocument.ps

Assume that you ps document yourdocumnet.ps contains three pages,
this will produce fax.g3.1 fax.g3.2 fax.g3.3

cat fax.g3 | g32pbm | pnmtops -noturn > output.ps     



How to print raw " no tiff " g3 fax data:



fax2tiff -M viewfax.g3 -o viewfax.tiff
(M for: Treat  input  data  as having bits filled from most
        significant bit (MSB) to most least bit (LSB))
This is what I need on my intel machine, I would presume this
might be different on a Sun station.
