As of 20Jan1999:

FIXED - kpanel -> panel (reported by Harri Porten)

FIXED - starts at 0,0 and is visible there until the panel swallows it.

FIXED - incorrect fr.kimap (reported and fixed by 
	binois stephane <binois@normandnet.fr>

- illisible/ugly flag icons + wrong highlighting colors in the keyboard 
	selection widget (reported by Torsten Rahn)

FIXED - fscked up startup (segfaults and all)

- conflict with vnc (???) (reported by Alex Zepeda)

FIXED - segfault on FreeBSD (because of API diffs in execlp) (reported by 
	Hans Petter Bieker <zerium@webindex.no>)

- Alt+Ctrl eats the next key (if window has menus) while Ctrl+Alt doesn't

FIXED (thanks to Dimitrios Bouras) - windows newer than kikbd insensitive 
	to map switching keyboard accelerator (e.g. Alt+Ctrl)  

FIXED? - segfault on Alpha because of uninitialised KObjConfig::version
