Fixed the last problem (tm) with kbgndwm config readings

Fixed a problem : When the common background changed, 
kpager didn't noticed if changing from wallpaper to a non-wallpaper mode.  

* Sat Dic 19 14:40:00 CEST 1998

Added some pedantic (though needed) comparisons . This made kpager
core dumps (reported by W.L. IJzerman)

Fixed a bug that displayed junk in some circunstances in the 
Desktop Name area when not showing names.

* Thu Dic 17 7:48:00 CEST 1998

Another fix for common desktop
(this kbgwm_change event was really kbgwm_reconfigure)

* Tue Dic 15 7:20:00 CEST 1998

Oops, I thought this common desktop was already fixed. 
I hope now it is.

Some bug fixes which made kpager core dump in different
ways (really nobody noticed this ?)

* Tue Dic  1 7:23:00 CEST 1998

Improved speed when updating background pictures (thanks Matt for the new signal !)
Hopefully the last fixes to the resize of windows 
(Now you can use kpager to create the largest window ever in the world
by resizing it and moving the mouse to the lower-right corner of your
screen :) )

* Mon Nov 30 7:20:00 CEST 1998 

Some fixes.
Implemented the option to disable the behaviour of
one click => desktop change (as suggested by Alexxx)
Finished implementing the resize of windows

of other desktop is not solved, I'll have to disable
this before 1.1)

implemented yet)

* Mon Nov 16 10:30:00 CEST 1998 

KPager now has a one-click way to work
It also highlights the window the cursor is over (not very useful right
now but will become useful next week :) )
It has some big bug fixes (they caused a core dump when setting the sticky bits
in some cases and a bug in the handling of stacking order )

* Sun Nov 15 15:00:00 CEST 1998 

Updated kpager to the new kbgndwm configure style
I still have to implement the new kbgndwm draw modes, but the
old ones already work

* Fri Nov 13 00:05:00 CEST 1998  Antonio Larrosa <larrosa@kde.org>

The arrow buttons now move whole desktop view when clicked and
still scrolls the view when pressed for a while (but faster than before)
as suggested by David Faure
Now a single click on a free area activates the desktop and also a double
click anywhere (just in case you don't have a free area)
