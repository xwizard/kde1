KWMSound -- A system sound module for KWM II
--------------------------------------------

This kwm II module takes care of emitting sounds for various (just
right now it would be fair to say only for a few...) system events.

The events that are currently supported are:

"Move to Desktop n" (you can have a different sound for every desktop)
"Open Window"
"Close Window"
"ActivateWindow" (a new window getting focus)
"Startup"

Currently, the sounds must be WAV-Files that are placed in the
following directory:

	$KDEDIR/share/sounds

kwmsound uses KDE's audio server to actually play back the sounds. 
So you must startup "kaudioserver" _before_ firing up "kwmsound".

Your startup script for your kde desktop could look like the following
example:

	kaudioserver &
	kwmsound &
	kbgndwm &
	krootwm &
	kfm &
	kpanel &
	kwm                 

Also the KDE mediatool would fire up "kaudioserver" automatically when
"kwmsound" starts up, it cannot hurt to start "kaudioserver"
explicitely...

You can use the KDE control center and the "syssound" module for kcc
to configure the system sounds.

     much fun with this useful tool... ;-)
