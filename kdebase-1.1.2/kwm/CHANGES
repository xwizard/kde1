       Changes file for kwm, the KDE window manager
       ============================================
 Developed and maintained by Matthias Ettrich (ettrich@kde.org)


kwm (since 0.10) was almost rewritten from scratch in C++.  Many ideas
and some code went in from my experiences with the former kwm, which I
originally based on David Hogan's 9wm (a smart and small windowmanager
written in plain C).


Current is 0.14.1 

In 0.14:
-------
patchlevel 3:
        - improved placement. Now application settings are ignore when the window
           is partially covered by either the panel or the taskbar (i.e. outside the 
           window region)

patchlevel 2:
        - internal: support for window names in COMPOUND_TEXT style

patchlevel 1:
        - fixed event passing: release no longer repeated to application

In 0.13:
--------
patchlevel 9:
        - fixed initial focus handling (non decorated windows where sometimes broken)
        - fixed occasional crashbugs when internal window close (such as minicli)
        - fixes for stays-on-top

patchlevel 8:
        - delayed internal event handling fix (kwm sometimes lost the 
           mouse on opaque resize)
        - minicli in-memory history has now a maximum limit (CT)
        - added handling for the KWM::staysOnTop property. The internal
           functionality was there already, just the activation was missing.
           Cannot break any existing code.

patchlevel 7:
        - small bugfixes
        - improved (faster) configure request handling
        - some support for windowgroups
        - fixed unClutter/cascade with standalone menubars

patchlevel 6:
        - dock window handling improved for restart
        - new CheckRaise option for focus follows mouse policies 
        - slightly improved the titlebar animation (Thorsten Scheuermann)


patchlevel 5:
        - animation of shaded windows improved
         - "restart" command in addition to "go:" and "configure"
         - sensitive handling of maximized windows when the window 
            region changes.

patchlevel 4:
        - improved handling for floating menubars

patchlevel 3:
        - fixed semantics with FocusFollowsMouse and AutoRaise:
               There are now two kwmrc properties:
                      AutoRaise=on/off
                      AutoRaiseInterval=0...x
               If the inner window command for the left mouse button contains
               any raise, this applies to the first click.

patchlevel 2:
        - some additions to the middle mouse handling to emulate
           the former behaviour with MMB-movement.
        - new signal "initialized" emited to modules when the
          initialization is finished.
	- titlebar font choosing enabled (CT)
	- title alignment (CT) 
		( kwmrc\[General]\TitleAlignment=[left|middle|right] )
	- stickyTitles, stickyClasses lists (in a [Sticky] section) 
		a la noDecor*, noFocus* lists (CT)

patchlevel 1:
        - simplified outline drawing since the previous nifty stippled
           rectangle relied on some graphic hardware support (which
           was not available with all cards). Result: kwm's outline
           drawing (transparent movement of windows) should speed up
           with these cards a lot.


In 0.12:
--------
patchlevel 4:
        - introduced some support for multi-screen displays
        - fixed some drag problems 
        - fixed more drag problems with opaque movement
        - hopefully fixed occasional freezes on certain X-Servers.

patchlevel 3:
        - honours KWM_WIN_ICON_GEOMETRY for iconify/deiconify animation
        - shaped window decorations faster and less flickering
        - border pixmaps fixed names got all a 'wm_' prefix. Name conflicts
		were reported. Sorry for all inconvenient.


patchlevel 2:
        - improved shaped window handling
	- CT: "pinned down" the pixmaps names for titlebar texture 
		and shaped borders. Now the only parameters necessary 
		in kwmrc to make these two features work are

		TitlebarLook=pixmap 
		ShapeMode=on

		The names of the pixmaps are no longer defined in the 
		kwmrc. They are fixed to: top.xpm, bottom.xpm, left.xpm, 
		right.xpm, topleft.xpm, topright.xpm, bottomleft.xpm, 
		bottomright.xpm, activetitlebar.xpm, inactivetitlebar.xpm. 
		All these pixmap s should to be found either in 
		$KDEDIR$/share/apps/kwm/pics/ or in 
		$USER_KDEDIR$ /share/apps/kwm/pics.

		This modification introduces consistancy with the technique 
		used to define titlebar buttons pixmaps and allows simplified
		theme constructions.

patchlevel 1:
        - first attempts of configurable mousebindings
patchlevel 0:
        - first attempts of configurable keybindings

In 0.11:
--------
patchlevel 14: 
        - internal cleanups with unmapNotify handling.
        - fixed the problems with java and dissappearing windows.

patchlevel 13: Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@kde.org>
        - added a replacement for gradientFill (for color depths
        higher than 8). It´s only used for horizontal gradients 
        - hopefully fixed Christoph Neerfeld's Ghostwindow problem
        - fixed a couple of memory leaks (thanks to Wolfgang Hoffmann)
        - kill clients on shutdown. Clients can react on that via
           KApplication's shutDown() signal.

patchlevel 12:
        - new property "ResizeAnimationSpeed". Default value is 1 
           (former behaviour), possible values range from 1 to 10
           (maximum speed). Kudos to Christian Tibirna for this.
	- Erratum (CT): "ResizeAnimation" config key now gets values
	   from 0 (no anim) to 10 (fastest) with 1 being the current
	   behaviour. ResizeAnimationSpeed is disabled (and deleted)
	   for redundancy reasons. Support is offered in kcontrol too.
        - electric borders dissabled per default
        - CDE style AltTab-Feature to have something usable with
            the classic focus policies. The CDE style is default with
            the classic focus policies, since KDE style does not 
            make much sense under these circumstances. For all
            other focus policies you may chose the style with
                 AltTabStyle=KDE/CDE
            Default is KDE, most certainly.
         - Alt-MMB lowers a window if it's already on the top

patchlevel 11:
        - switchActivateClient (used by the taskbar or the current
           session manager) ensures visibility of the window according
           to the user's current placement policy
        - focus warning box appears only one time per session now.
        - visual feedback when preparing the session for logout
        - new command "go:other" which will kill all modules and 
           replace kwm with the other process.
        

patchlevel 10:
        - Warning message for crappy focus policies only occurs with Alt-Tab now.
            The ACTIVATE_WINDOW client message (used by modules such as 
            kpanel(taskbar) and kpager) will be interpreted as change-to-the-desktop-
            and-raise-the-window instead.



patchlevel 9 (CT - 27May98):
	- SnapToWindow and SnapToBorder FUNCTIONS replaced with snapIt. The
	    user-visible configurability remains the same. The on-screen
	    effect is nonetheless improved.
	- replaced "shaded" option by "shadedHorizontal" and "shadedVertical".
	   For the moment it seems vertical shading is much more rapid (of
	   course, much less gradient steps to calculate in KPixmap).
                - small bugfix to allow runtime switching between vertical and horizontal (Matthias)
                - small fix to avoid a double calling of Manager::sendConfig after a 
                   drag/resize in opaque mode(Matthias)
                - bugfix for double buffering (confusing dst and src in bitBlt is a bad idea....)
  
patchlevel 8:
        - WindowResizeType=Opaque improved. No more flickering and a 
            bit faster. Still not perfect in combination with horizontal shading. 

patchlevel 7:
        - Some new properties for the kwmrc:

                [Decoration]
                noDecorationTitles=,
                tinyDecorationTitles=,
                noDecorationClasses=,
                tinyDecorationClasses=,
	[Focus]
	noFocusTitles=,
	noFocusClasses=,

            Each property allows you to specify a comma separated list
            of regular expressions. A window whose title or class
            matches a specified expression will be decorated appropriately. 
            Note: these hints only affect NEW windows. Do not forget to 
            call "kwmcom configure" or to restart kwm after you changed the
            kwmrc file.

        - cleanups and performance improvements for horziontal shading 
           and titlebar animation 

patchlevel 6:
        - horizontal shading (blending) a la kpixmap
        - fixed motif decoration hint handling. Useful for the fullscreen view
           of the acrobat reader.
 
patchlevel 5:
        - no more harecoded "Helvetica" font. kwm uses the generalFont instead.
        - two new focus policies: CLASSIC_FOCUS_FOLLOWS_MOUSE and
           CLASSIC_SLOPPY_FOCUS. Both break the fancy Alt-Tab feature as well as
           the "switch-to"-function in the taskmanager/taskbar. Anyway, old hand twm
           fans seems unable to live without _true_ focus follows mouse :-) 
        - changed autoraise semantics: autoraise only works when the pointer is 
           inside the window. Just having the focus is no longer sufficient.
        - fixed manual placement in combination with electricBorders. Did I already
           mention that I hate all these options....grrr.........
        - ElectricBorderMovePointer is obsolete and no longer supported. Instead there
           is a new option: ElectricBorderPointerWarp=NoWarp,MiddleWarp,FullWarp
        - some improvements for reparenting

patchlevel 4:
        - raised the number of possible virtual desktops to 32. Note that you need
           a current libkdecore to take the full benefit from this.
        - electric borders need to be "pushed" if you want to switch to another virtual 
           desktop without dragging a window. The number of pushes within the
           timeframe given by the ElectricBorder property is defined in the new property
           ElectricBorderNumberOfPushes. The default is 5.
        - small fix to generate less toplevel windows

patchlevel 4:
        - new option: WindowResizeType={Opaque, Transparent}

patchlevel 3:
        - "snap to border" and "snap to window" modified: they are
           working in "real time", now. The default is 10 pixel for
           both. This made my older edge resitance obsolete (removed)
         - doNotManage understands regular expressions
         - self transient windows can be moved to other virtual desktops

patchlevel 2:
	- fixed a bunch of bugs with smart placement, cascade placement,
	  unclutter, snap to border and snap to window (bugs given mostly
	  by the wrong assumption that te client's geometry is defined
	  relative to free desk space). Thanks Stephan (CT)
        - fixed a nasty pointer-grab bug for window movement

patchlevel 1:
	- fixed the avoidance of shaded windows bug in smart placement.
	  Ugly fix. Ugh! (CT)
	- snap to border and snap to window functions (CT). Maximum limit
	  arbitrarily fixed at 50 pixels. Complain if you're unhappy with :-)

patchlevel 0: (Matthias? Bernd?)

In 0.10:
--------
patchlevel 33:
        - new property "EdgeResistance=<value>". Default value is 50
        - bugfix for electric borders
        - bugfix for winMove and winResize (internal pointer grabbing)
        - bugfix for interactive (manual) placement: now the whole
          window is painted :)
        - bugfix for electric borders (Diego Zamboni) 

patchlevel 32:
	- fixed bugs:   interactive placement persistence
			transient windows placed interactively (NOT!) (CT)
	- deskUnclutter and deskCascade commands (to issue through kwmcom
	   in minicli for the moment; krootwm menu entries soon) (CT)

patchlevel 31: 
	-- Bernd: minor fixes (typos in the sound events)
       - small fix for alt-tab
       - changed "ElectricBorderMovePointer" values to on/off to be 
         consitent with the rest of kwm.

patchlevel 30:
	-- Bernd: 
	
	Further improved Electric Borders. They can now be graphically
        configured using a kcontrol module and also completely turned off.
	
patchlevel 29:
  
  	- Bernd:
  	ElectricBorders are great but difficult to use. Added option
	ElectricBorderMovePointer which takes 0 or 1 as parameter.
	If ElectricBorderMovepointer is 0 ( false) the original behaviour
	implemented by Matthias is exhibited. If it is 1 ( true) the
	mouse pointer is moved to the middle of the desktop after
	an 'electric border' desktop switch.
	
  
  patchlevel 28:  
     - added WindowsPlacement=interactive,10 and 
	WindowsPlacement=manual. The number after interactive indicates
	what percentage from the current desktop array should represent
	the total overlap area before manual placement to be enforced. 
	This value can be bigger than 100 :-) (Cristian Tibirna)
     - fixed iconified windows avoidance bug in smart placement (CT)
     - electric borders: Just move the cursor to the border of
       the screen, wait a short time and kwm will magically change the
       current virtual desktop. The interval can be specified in 
       milliseconds with the ElectricBorder property in the kwmrc. 
       ElectricBorder=-1 dissables the feature.

         
  patchlevel 27:
     - support for shaded windows a la openstep.
     - new option:
             TitlebarDoubleClickCommand=winMaximize/winShade/winMove/
                 winResize, winRestore/winIconify/winClose/winSticky/
                 winOperations

       Please notice the "winShade" function :)

       Shading raises two new sounds:
                  "Window Shade Up"
                  "Window Shade Down"

       [ I do not know how OpenStep handles this, but I think it is 
         a feature that the bounding box (when dragging a shaded window
         in transparent mode) shows the original size! ]

       Hopefully kcmkwm will soon support this feature, too.

     - new windowPlacement=cascade (Cristian Tibirna)
     - new option
                      TraverseAll=on/off
       which makes Alt-Tab traverse all windows on all virtual desktops.
       Default is "off", which means that Alt-trab traversal is only
       possible on the current desktop.
     - small bugfix for FreeBSD (Marc van Kempen)
     - menuButton (if defined) on the top
     - Extended semantics for AutoRaise in FocusFollowsMouse mode:
                 AutoRaise=-1 
       This will not start an auto timer, but you can raise the most recent
       activated window with a simple click inside the window (= Raise
       on first click)
     - fixed a dirty bug with the rstart protocol (I mixed up 
       QStrings and Char*.... grrr.....)
       

  patchlevel 26:
     - fixed double click problem with java/motif on some X-Servers

  patchlevel 25:
     - smart placement (Cristian Tibirna)
     - "Window Activate" sound event (I simply forgot this one...)
     - more fixes for the sound events

  patchlevel 24:
       - supports the following commands in addition:

     refreshScreen, darkenScreen, logout, commandLine, taskManager,
     configure, winMove, winResize, winMaximize, winRestore,
     winIconify, winClose, winSticky, winOperations, desktop1,
     desktop2, desktop3, desktop4, desktop5, desktop6, desktop7,
     desktop8, desktop+1, desktop+2, desktop-1, desktop-2, desktop%2


  patchlevel 23:
       - support for KDE SOUND EVENTS.
         raises: 
                  "Window Iconify"
                  "Window DeIconify"
                  "Window Maximize"
                  "Window UnMaximize"
                  "Window Sticky"
                  "Window UnSticky"
                  "Window New"
                  "Window Delete"
                  "Window Trans New"
                  "Window Trans Delete"
                  "Logout"
                  "Logout Message"
                  "Window Move Start"
                  "Window Move End"
                  "Window Resize Start"
                  "Window Resize End"

      Also passes KDE_SOUND_EVENT, KDE_REGISTER_SOUND_EVENT and
      KDE_UNREGISTER_SOUND_EVENT to the modules. REGISTER-events are
      stored. That means it is possible to launch the sound module after
      the applications without losing any registered sound-event.

 
       - fix for the session management proxy (Gerd Knorr)

  patchlevel 22:
       - fixes for the screen-shading during logout. The old way had
         severe problems with backing store. (Christian Czezatke)
       - support for shaped window decorations:
                ShapeMode=on
                ShapePixmapTop=...
                ShapePixmapBottom=...
                ShapePixmapLeft=...
                ShapePixmapRight=...
                ShapePixmapTopLeft=...
                ShapePixmapTopRight=...
                ShapePixmapBottomLeft=...
                ShapePixmapBottomRight=...
         There are some (ugly) example pixmaps under ./images

       - made the taskwindow look a little bit nicer, including their
	 mini icons (Mario Weilguni)

  patchlevel 21:
       - fix for motif applications: program-defined positioning will
         be ignored while user-defined positiong still works.
         Most toolkits define user-defined if it is is programm-defined
         anyway so this should not harm.
       - fixes and enhancements for dock-windows
       - support for KWM_DO_NOT_MANAGE command (smoother swallowing)

  patchlevel 20:
       - self-transient do not crash kwm anymore
       - new option:
              Button3Grab=on/off  
         to make "missbehaving" clients like GIMP usable on a KDE desktop.
       - new kwmrc-option: RstartProtocol. Defaults to "rstart -v"
       - support for noFocus property
       - on fast X-Servers the resize animation sometimes left a tiny 
         rectangle: fixed
  
  patchlevel 19:
       - small fixes for swallowing
       - bugfix for  TitlebarPixmapActive
       - auto-iconify-on-focus-loss applies only for floating windows
         (like kde toolbars or kde menubars)
       - re-introduced explicit XUnmapWindow calls for the inner windows.
         This is important for video cards etc. I hope I did not break 
         anything.
       - resize animation improved (thanks to Hans-Guenther Nusseck)
       - bugfixes for auto-iconify

  patchlevel 18:
       - transient windows become iconified if the main window loses
         the focus (and none of its transient gets it instead!)
       - combind history completion with kURLcompletion in minicli

       - minicli changes by Torben:
           - minicli does handle URLs now like http://....
           - minicli handles URLs like "www.xxx" or "ftp.xxxx"
           - minicli handles dirctories like "/home/weis"
           - minicli has tab completion ( use TAB and Ctrl+D )
           - minicli supports the URL man:
           - minicli understand #kill, this will search the
	             man page for kill and is a shortcut for man:kill

       - new options TitlebarPixmapActive/TitlebarPixmapInactive. Used
         for TitlebarLook=pixmap
       - few bugfixes for kwmpager
       - small fix in handling of windows which do not request the
         WM_DELETE_WINDOW protocol (Did YOU know XKillClient? %-} )

  patchlevel 17:
       - fixed a serious bug (crashing clients when dragging in 
         opaque mode)
       - tiny fix for gravity handling
       - *many* modifications to autoraise
       - fix for FocusFollowsMouse
       - animation a bit faster
       - small fix for resize/move with the mouse 
       - works together with newest kfm to keep the root icons 
         lowered
       - small fix for setting the kwm_running property
       - fixed a very old bug: now you can press Control-F1
         Control-F2 Control-F1 Control-F2 Control-F1 Control-F2
         like a maniac without any windows loosing their frames :-)
       - kURL-completion (Torben Weis, Henner Zeller)
       - fixed a bug that menu-button-click sometimes closes a window

  patchlevel 16:
       - fix for "move" via keyboard (pointer warp)
       - autoraise fixes
       - fixed the "kwm needs cpu when dragging windows" bug
       - ontoDesktop also moves the transient windows
       - transient windows cannot be moved onto different desktops
         separately anymore
       - transient windows cannot be iconified separately anymore
       - few smaller fixes

       - cosmectic problem with my pushbuttons fixed
       - sticky cares about transient windows now

       - fix for proxyignore
       - window dragging fixed (problems with some compilers)

  patchlevel 15:
       - transient windows are iconified/deiconified with their parent
         window. They also dissappear for the modules and the Mod1-Tab
         traversal if they were automatically iconified.
       - new commandline option "-nosession" to disable the restoration
         of the previous session.
       - new list entry "proxyignore" in the [session]-group of kwmrc
         to specify WM_COMMANDS that should be ignored
       - fixed the minicli-focus-follows-mouse problem
       - yakb fixed for Stephan, small adaption to new kcc module
          
  patchlevel 14:
       - new keybindings Control-F[1..8] for virtual desktop switching
       - new option "ControlTab=[on,off]" to switch off the Control-Tab
         shortcut.
       - fixed the "last window is iconified and deficonified"-focus-
         followss-mouse-bug
       - fixed the autoraise-over-operations-menu bug 
       - Uwe's fix for the timing problem of the resize animation
       - history command completion with Tab in minicli
       - KProcess for execution
       - Fix for unsavedDataHint handling

  patchlevel 13:
       - new decoration style (tiny decoration). Useful for floating
         menu- or toolbars. Can be set via KWM::setDecoration(...)
       - KWM::geometry(Window w, bool including_frame = FALSE) has
         including_frame as additional argument. Useful for
         pager modules.
       - workaround to the "X freezes when pasting in minicli"-bug
         
  patchlevel 12:
       - new command "execute" for minicli (temporary solution until
         we finally get a real kcli)

  patchlevel 11:
       - session management for unamanged windows modified. Since this
         is a KDE special for applications like kfm, other programms
         make trouble (for example Netscape 4) (Needs current libkdecore!)
       - session management fix (Netscape 3 et. al.)
       - placement: transient windows always on the desktop of their parent
       - desktop placement fixed for withdraw-by-client windows
       - maximize/sticky fixed (bug with hidden buttons)
       - For modules: no kwm_win_change before kwm_win_add (hopefully)
       - menu button on first position also appears for transient windows
         (to keep the pretty miniicon visible)
  patchlevel 10:
       - internal changes to module registration. (Needs the newest
         libkdecore to work)
       - Alt-MouseButton fix: works regardless NumLock/Capslock now
       - correct cursorfont for Alt-RMB rsize and Alt-LMB move
       - fixed control/tab release
  patchlevel 9:
       - small fix for kwm modules
       - further qt-1.3 changes: with 1.3 the mouse sometimes hang
         for the global modal dialogs (session manager et. al.)
  patchlevel 8:
       - needs qt-1.3
       - for modules: 
            KWM_WIN_DESKTOP handling fixed
            KWM_DESKTOP_NAME_CHANGE and KWM_DESKTOP_NUMBER_CHANGE
       - some smaller improvements

  patchlevel 7:
       - improved KConfig handling (uses strlists :-)
       - small bugfix with module registration (introduced with some cleanups
         in the previous patchlevel...)
       - cleaner pushButton class (behaves slightly different now)

  patchlevel 6:
       - small fix to execute(...);
       - maximizeButton has different semantics for LMB, MMB and RMB
         (README updated)

  patchlevel 5
       - should work under qt-1.3 AND qt-1.2 now. Qt-1.2 support needs
         some dirty lowlevel X-Hacks and will probably be removed as
         soon as qt-1.3 will be KDE's offical qt-version.
       - Tab-Box uses three different horizontal sizes now.


  patchlevel 4
       - small bug with buttons remaining raised fixed. Was introduced
         in the previous patchlevel with the avoid-flickering patch:(

  patchlevel 3:
       - session management can handle even crappy missbehaving clients
         like xfig, which destroy their window instead of saving theirselfs.
         kwm even enables the proxy (if possible) for those lying programs.
         (Please do not look at the hacks necessary to support this rubbish)
       - no more flickering with opaque move and FocusFollowsMouse
       - Alt-Tab works now even with FocusFollowsMouse
       - Alt-Tab/Control-Tab can be aborted with Escape (Thanks to Christian
         for this idea)
       - re-enabled MWM decoration hints for StarOffice (floatwinshells)
       - kwm_desktop_change contains new desktop as argument
       - unknown commands are sent to the modules as described in kwm.h
       - session management now possible for unmapped windows (usefull
         for example for kfm). Please see kwm.h for details.

  patchlevel 2:
       - fixed the frames-are-dissappearing-and-qt-focus-not-working
         bug I introduced in patchlevel 1 :-(
       - tiny fixes / improvements for KWMModuleApplication

  patchlevel 1:
       - "-version" command line argument
       - Alt-MMB fixed
       - bugfix in module registration 
       - bugfix in X error handling during initialization


Some changes beside the rewrite since previous kwms:

 - well documentated libkwm allows clients to communicate with the
   windowmanager in an easy way (will go into libkdecore as kwm.h) 
 - more complete README including a mini-FAQ
 - does not select button events from the root window.
   Rootwindow handling will be done by krootwin.
 - Session management (uses the rstart-command for remote machines)
 - Session management proxy for applications which cannot do real
   session management (almost all X-Applications, unfortunately)
 - logout dialog displays clients who cannot do session management or do
   very poor pseudo session management a la xterm or xedit:
   Just select the client to jump to his window.
 - logout dialog also display clients who can do session management but
   set the KWM_WIN_UNSAVED_DATA property to True. Just select the client 
   to jump to his window.
 - nicer Ctrl-Tab virtual desktop switching
 - nicer Alt-Tab window switching (takes care about the focus-traversal
   order and shows a pretty box with icons)
 - [Alt/Control]-Escape shows a pretty "current session"-box
 - improved windows stacking (no more flickering)
 - nicer resize animation (cares about the server respond time)
 - nicer outlines (kwm style :-)
 - unique window titles (a la emacs buffers)
 - close will destroy the window for clients that do not understand
   WM_DELETE_WINDOW: No need for a "destroy" menu item anymore.
 - New shortcut Control-Alt-Escape allows to select a window that
   needs to be destroyed because the application hangs (a la xkill)
 - sensitive window operations popup
 - Maximize button appears only for windows which can be maximized
   (this can change for windows during runtime)
 - Module communication via X properties. As a side effect you can also
   restart kwm and all windows will be in correct state on their former
   virtual desktops
 - Menu button shows the window's icon (if one is defined) scaled to 14x14.
   Applications can also define a special miniicon via libkwm.
 - The desktop names and the number of desktops are stored in the kwmrc
   now, no longer in the global kderc. Clients have nevertheless easy read
   and write access to these properties via libkwm.
 - Also stores the window regions (for maximize and the random placement)
   for each virtual desktop. These can also be modified easily via libkwm.
 - extra communication with kdisplay not needed anymore

        - focus handling fixed (Matthias)
        - no more weird reshape menuitem (Matthias) 
        - some memory optimizations (~50kB data during runtime 
          with a default kfm started) (Matthias)
        - small fix for Brian's root-menus (they took the grab
          away of minicli) (Matthias)
        - hopefully fixed drag and resize jumpings of windows (Matthias)
        - jumping icons and kpanel fixed (Matthias)

In 0.5
        - Titlebar colors are settable from kdisplay (I hope?)
	  Non-default colors are currently NOT rememebered from
	  session to session, so you will need to do a kdisplay -init.
	  Sorry for the flicker this will cause for now.
	- Updated Titlebar options dialog
	- kdisplay can be called from RMB
	- Compiles against Qt-1.2
        - AutoConfiguration, thanks to Stephan Kulow
	- No drag latency for Transparent Move (Bernd's Buttered Mouse)
        - Global Keyboard Accelerators.  Currently limited and hardcoded
	
________________
In 0.4.8

	- Menubar removed. (See RMB root menu for options)
        - More ghost window hunting
	- Matthias' patches listed
below     

- new command kwm_release_window, which allows kpanel and other
modules to swallow windows 
- updating of kwm's internal windowlist when the title changes
  (sorry Brian, couldn't resit to add this one-liner :-)
- iconfied windows in the windowlist are now inside brackets.
- kwm_changed_window now also sends the state to the modules
  ( 1 == IconicState, 0 otherwise), as well as kwm_add_window. 
- kwm_minimize_window will unminimize if the window is already iconified
- xpm instead of xbm for window decoration and some nice xpms almost
  according one of Mark's proposals.

________________
In 0.2.2

	- X button closes app nicely. Thanks to Eric Johnson.
	- MMB lowers window.  RMB bring up operations menu.
        - Fixed configurereq bug.  Now xv et. al. shouldn't chop
	  pictures or wander around.
	- There are some different button group patterns under
	  options.
	- This source code is getting pretty silly from messing
	  with various solutions.  I really don't want to
	  strip some of the obnoxious stuff yet, 'cause I might
	  find a gem.  The cleaning is on my schedule for 
	  v0.3 (the release number for when it has virtual
	  desktop support)
	
________________
In 0.2.1

        - Added X button (a la Bernd) which destroys window.
	  I want to make it close nicely instead, tho'.
	- Iconify on operations popupmenu works
	- Changed inactive titlebar colors to be readable
	  Hope this isn't too obnoxious for those with fewer bpp.
	- Added restart to File menu. (Clean up your windows menu :)
	- Pushpin pixmap for "sticky" button.
	- Includes Acli 0.6
	- Selecting item from Windows menu now also raises that item.
	  Before, you could "lose" a window when unMinimizing it.
	- Fixed titlebar label.  It used to say things like "rxvt"
	  even if you used -T "title name".  Now it shows "title name".
	  Let me know if you get some other wierd results.
	- Client x,y,dx,dy now refer to Client object, not app inside.
	  This spawns the following fixes more easily and greatly
	  simplifies the code.
	- Both opaque and transparent move work with the correct
	  size bounding box and no jumping boxes.
	- Windows are correctly positioned.

----------------
In 0.2
        - Menu bar
	- Minimization works
	- Adding items to window list works, removing doesn't
	- Transparent Move support
	- Quit from menu bar
	- Options of transparent/opaque move

All changes above this point were made by Brian Cooper 
except as noted.
------------

since 0.1.p1

        - fixed many many bugs (some where old 9wm bugs...). Kwm shouldn't
           segfault anymore yet, at least not with my testing programs ;-)  (Matthias)
        - small changes to window positioning (Matthias)
        - shaped windows aren't decorated anymore (Matthias)
