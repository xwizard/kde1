Konsole is an X terminal designed to replace kvt.

Note that many KDE applications directly execute kvt. Since this is not
configurable, you might (cd $KDEDIR; mv kvt kvt.ori; ln -s konsole kvt)
to integrate konsole fully into the K Desktop Environment.

Before sending out any reports about broken or missing features, please
check the newest TODO and the html documentation that comes with konsole.
There are still a few loose ends.

Share and enjoy,
