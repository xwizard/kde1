<H2>Users</H2>
From here you can change the way users are represented in the login window.
<A HREF="#IMAGE"><H3>Images</H3></A>
<A HREF="#SELECT"><H3>Select users</H3></A>
<P>
<A NAME="IMAGE"><H3>Images</H3></A>
Every user on the system is represented by a image. The image for the user is 
kept in a file called <CODE>$(KDEDIR)/share/apps/kdm/pics/users/$(USER).xpm.
</CODE><BR>
If the user doesn't have such a file the file
<CODE>$(KDEDIR)/share/apps/kdm/pics/users/default.xpm</CODE> will be used instead.<BR>
To assign a new image to a user just selct the user in one of the listboxes 
and:
<UL>
<LI>Drop an imagefile on the image button to the right.
</UL>
or
<UL>
<LI>Click on the image button and select a new image from the image selector.
</UL>
If no user is currently selected you will be asked if you want to change the 
default image.<BR>
The replacement is performed by a KFM process so if the imagefile allready 
exists you will be prompted by KFM if you wan't to replace it. If you confirm 
the image will be replaced - you will NOT have to press the "Apply" button.
<P>
<A NAME="SELECT"><H3>Select users</H3></A>
If you choose not to show users, the users will have to write their user name 
at the login window. If you choose to show users they can simply click on an 
icon representing themself, enter their password an click "Go".
<P>
The pages contains three listboxes. The large listbox on the left shows all 
the users on the system which we may presume could be a genuine user.<BR>
The top rightmost listbox shows the slected users and the bottom rightmost 
listbox shows the users we don't want displayed in the login window.
To move a user from one listbox to another you click on the username in the 
listbox and selects ">>" to move the user from the leftmost box the the 
rightmost box - or "<<" to move the user from the rightmost box to the 
leftmost box.
<P>
The users to show can be selected in two ways:
<UL>
<LI>Selected users only: Show only users in the top rightmost listbox. Select 
the users from the leftmost listbox and click on the top ">>" button to move 
them to the selected users listbox. Then select the radio-button "Show only 
selected users".
<LI>All but no-show users: Show all users but the ones from the bottom left 
listbox. Select the users you dont want to show from the leftmost listbox and 
move them to the "No-show" listbox by clicking on the bottom ">>" button.
</UL>
