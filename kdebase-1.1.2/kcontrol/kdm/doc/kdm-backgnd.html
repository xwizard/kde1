<H2>Background</H2>
Here you can change the desktop background which will be displayed when a user
logs in. You can have a single color or an image as a background. If you have 
an image as background and select center the selected background color will be
used around the image if it isn't large enough to cover the entire desktop.
<P>
To change the default background color simply click on the color botton and 
select a new color.
<P>
To select a new background image you can either select an image from the 
drop-down list or select "Browse..." and select an image file from a file 
selector.
<P>
The image can be displayed in three different ways:
<UL>
<LI>Tiled: The image will be duplicated until it fills the entire desktop.
<LI>Centred: The image will be centred in the middle of the desktop with the 
original size.
<LI>Scaled: The image will be scaled to fit the desktop.
</UL>
