	 KCMDISPLAY &  KBGNDWM
	------------------------


This is README for two programs : kbgndwm and kcmdisplay - background module
Both are part of KDE and require kwm to work properly.


Some new features :

1. One Desktop radio button -
   some people want only one wallpaper for all desktop
   - however, also this one desktop can be set to randomize

2. Random radio button - whether to use one wallpaper for a desktop or 
   randomly choose from the list.

3. Setup push button - opens dialog for setup of randomizing
   - you can specify timer interval in miliseconds
   - use drag and drop to create list of items
   - you can create any kind of items, they do not have to contain wallpaper
     f.e create two color background with a pattern
   - use Add button for adding item with "No wallpaper"
   - use Delete button to delete items
   - in-order radio button - whether you want kbgndwm to choose files in order
                             or randomly
   - for each desktop you may specify list of items ( using drag and drop )
     and timer interval.
   - kbgndwm will at given interval change wallpapers on desktops.

4. Docking radio button - kbgndwm can dock into kpanel. If you click on dock
   window and random mode is set, then kbgndwm will change wallpaper without
   waiting on timer
   - clicking with right button opens popup menu with two items :
      "Background Settings" will start "kcmdisplay background"

   quickly change wallpaper in the monitor
