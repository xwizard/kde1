This is a KDE Control Center Module for configuring system sounds. 

Currently, system sounds have to be in $KDEDIR/share/sounds

However, you can now drop audio files on the Sounds listbox
to add them to the list of selectable sounds.

For more information have a look at the readme in "kwmsound"

Hope you'll enjoy KDE system sounds... ;-)
