	* Fixed three bugs before 1.1.2:
	1) The "session type" wasn't updated when the user left the login line
	edit with Tab (Pressing return worked fine). This is fixed now.
	2) Kdm accepts NOBROADCAST in the Xaccess file now.
	3) PAM modules now have the ability to set environment variables
	for the user. Without this patch, changes to the env. are lost.

	* kdmshutdown.cpp :
	Changed char[] to QString. We want unicode ;)

1998-12-16 Duncan Haldane <f.d.m.haldane@cwix.com>

	* kdmshutdown.cpp : 
	(1) made the PAM service name configurable
	if KDE_PAM_SERVICE is defined (if not, it is "xdm"). (This
	should have been done when I did this to verify.c a while
	back).
	
	(2) Added a extra line to the shutdown dialog box
	"(Enter Root password") if it is in "RootOnly" mode.

	(3) Changed the confusing description of the "exit xdm" button
	to "Restart X server", which is the actual function of the
	third button.

	* genauth.c (len;): Read random data from "randomFile" (usually
		/dev/mem) for auth key.

	* kgreeter.cpp (GreetUser): Removed hardcoded backspace

	* Make the authentication cookie more unpredictable by adding
	times from X events to seed
