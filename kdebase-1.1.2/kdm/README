This is version v0.5 of the KDE Display Manager (kdm). 

Kdm is intended as a "drop-in" replacement of xdm. It reads the xdm
specific files (usually in /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xdm), so it should not be
necessary to change them. The KDE configuration is in the file
$(KDEDIR)/config/kdmrc. Please look at the HTML and the example kdmrc.

CHANGES/NEW FEATURES:

* Autoconf
* Bugfixes
* -kdedir option

HOW TO COMPILE KDM:

  setenv QTDIR /where/you/have/qt
  setenv KDEDIR /usr/local/kde
  [check options with "./configure --help"]
  ./configure --with-some-options
  make
  make install
  [read html docs]
  [Then be sure to run kdmdesktop from the xdm setup script -- on most
  systems called /usr/X11/lib/X11/xdm/Xsetup_0 or similar]

configure will look for your xdm configuration files and use them. If
the files aren't found, you can give the explicit path with the
--with-xdmdir option. If this is still not good, new xdm config files
are installed. These require hand editing before use. You might want to
look at the files in the "samples" directory. They show how to make
Xsession scripts for different window managers and setups.

Thanks to (in no particular order):
Michael Bach Jensen and Torsten Rahn for drawing icons.
Duncan Haldane for investigation of PAM issues.
Stephan Kulow for helping me with the autoconf stuff.
Martin Baehr for intensive testing and writing the sample Xsession scripts.

kdm is free software. I'm not sure exactly how it's license is, because it
has a lot of code from xdm in it. Anyway, i have to state:

[Your package] requires the Qt library, which is copyright Troll Tech AS. 
Freely distributable programs may generally use Qt for free, 
see the file README.QT for details. Anyone is allowed to change kdm and 
redistribute the result as long as my name is mentioned.

And by the way: kdm is provided as is with no warranty of any kind, 
including the warranty of design, merchantability and fitness for a particular
purpose.

Have fun with it (and feel free to comment),

------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is kdm the KDE replacement for the X Display Manager "xdm".

In fact it's just a new greeter for the xdm, which was programmed
in a way that a replacement of the greeter module is possible.

It should also be possible to replace the greeter with a dynamic library,
but for some reason I wasn't able to do that on my Linux machine.
But since the standard xdm on Linux doesn't use this dynamic library
anyway and recompilation of xdm doesn't take a minute at all, I don't
see a problem with that.


CHANGES TO THE ORIGINAL XDM

- added this README
- renamed Imakefile to Imakefile.original
- added a new Imakefile and a subdirectory "kgreeter"
- renamed all occurrences of "->class" to "->class2" since
  "class" is a keyword in C++

DIFFERENCES FROM XDM

- a nice window with Qt-widgets to enter your login and password

REQUIREMENTS
  
  - Qt-1.42 or newer and kdelibs from KDE 1.1
    You should also define $QTDIR and $KDEDIR

  - the background needs the "utopia" type-1 font.
    IMO everybody should have these free type-1 fonts. Using
    programs like "LyX" or the "KDE Help System" is much more
    comfortable with them, since suddenly even larger fonts
    remain readable :-)

    Anyway kdm works without "utopia", too, but the background doesn't
    look too pretty since the font will be a bit pixelized.


KNOWN BUGS 

in kdm-0.[1-5]: 
  - the "BackSpace"-key had the wrong meaning on my XServer.
    So I hardcoded a   
           KeySym mysym = XK_BackSpace;
           XChangeKeyboardMapping(*dpy, 22, 1, &mysym, 1);
    Is this Ok? Is there a better solution?

Best regards and I hope you enjoy the hopefully nice-looking 
brand new graphically login to your workstation,
