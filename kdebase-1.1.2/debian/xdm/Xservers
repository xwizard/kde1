# /etc/X11/kdm/Xservers
#
# This file should contain entries to start the servers on the
# local machine; if you have more than one display (not screen),
# you can add entries to the list (one per line).  If you also
# have some X terminals connected which do not support XDMCP,
# you can add them here as well.  Each X terminal line should
# look like:
#	XTerminalName:0 foreign
#
# When adding X servers, please keep the following things in mind:
# - For each X server other than :0, the display number must be
#   on the command line.
# - This is the place to add the -bpp option to the command line.
# - It is wise to add the vtXX  option to each local X server, 
#   since this is the only sure way of knowing in advance which
#   X server attaches to which console.
#
# Example:
# :0 local /usr/bin/X11/X :0 vt9 -bpp 16
# :1 local /usr/bin/X11/X :1 vt10 -bpp 8
#
:0 local /usr/bin/X11/X vt7
