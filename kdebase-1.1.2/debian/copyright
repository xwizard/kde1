kvt :
From: "J.D.Bovey" <J.D.Bovey@ukc.ac.uk>

     I'm currently patching and hacking rxvt which was made on xvt .
     The copying policy for xvt was : "Do what you want (...) but no
     money" .

     Could you please change this copyright to GPL ?  (GPL basically
     says : do what you want but include source code, if you use this
     source code for another progam, he must also be distributed under
     GPL .  Source code must be freely available but you can sell the
     program, if of course you let the buyer do what he wants with the
     program, including giving it for free to other peoples ...)

     Do you want a full copy of the GPL ?

     I'm asking that because I see your copyright is not respected :
     rxvt can be found on cdroms which are sold, etc ... so theese
     people are breaking your copyright ... but rxvt is such a good
     program I'd like it to spread even more through X users ... what
     GPL can allow !

     GPL would be quite the same than your actual copyright, it only
     include one more restriction (include source code) and let people
     get programs for free .

     Is GPL ok for rxvt ?

     Please email me back (I'm currently on vacation in France :-) I'll
     respond as soon as possible !

If you want to change the copying policy of rxvt to GPL then I have
no objection to that.
