How to get 'who' and 'talkd' to work correctly with kvt.
-----------------------------------------------------

The key to this is the utmp.c file. Unfortunately the location of the
utmp file which logs loggins varies from system to system, so by
default kvt compiles without utmp logging. Howver, if you want
to use talkd or finger or similar you need to have kvt write
to the utmp file. Here is how to achive that:

a) edit utmp.c and add the following twolines to it:

#define UTMP_SUPPORT 1
#define HAVE_LASTLOG_H 1

you may get by without the second line ...

b) locate the location of your utmp file and replace 

#ifndef UTMP
#define UTMP "/etc/utmp"
#endif

by  

#ifndef UTMP
#define UTMP "/where/my/utmpfile/resides/utmp"
#endif

On RedHat 5.0 this would be /var/run/utmp for example.

Recompile kvt and make sure that /var/run/utmp is world writeable,
eg. chmod 666 /where/my/utmpfile/resides/utmp

In fact, I have enough other free code to maintain and Mr. Berberic
has very few time.

So, if you like to maintain kvt, just drop us a note.
