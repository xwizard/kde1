<P>
<P>We sincerely hope that using the KDE gives you so much fun and
pleasure that you never want to log out. But if you do, simply click
the small X-like button on the panel, just above the padlock button.

<H3><A NAME="ss7.1">7.1 Session Management</A>
</H3>

<P>When you log out, KDE remembers which applications you had open,
as well as where all the windows were located, so that it can
open them for you the next time you log in. This feature is termed
<EM>Session Management</EM>. KDE-aware applications will restore themselves to the
state they were in when you logged out: for example, kedit remembers which file
you were editing. Non-KDE applications do not memorize their state on logout,
and KDE will warn you to make sure that you have saved any important
data in them when you start to log out.
<P>To illustrate session management, choose 
<B>
<A HREF="index-3.html#starter">application starter</A> > Applications >
Editor</B> to start KEdit. Open a text document to edit. Now log out and back
in. You will observe that KEdit will be restored to the exact same position on
the screen, including the right virtual desktop and the document we left
open in KEdit before we logged out is opened again automatically. 
KEdit will even remember whether you had unsaved changes to your
document before you logged out and will save them to the file 
you were working on if you choose 'Save' from the 'File menu'.
