<P>We hope you enjoyed this brief tour of the K Desktop environment and
that this unique desktop environment will help you get
your work done faster and more comfortably than ever.
<P>Please remember that the KDE project is not a commercial venture, but
rather a project run by volunteers from all over the world. We would 
like to invite you to join the KDE project and become part of this
unique network of people. If you are a programmer
you might consider helping us write KDE applications. If you are an artist or
have experience with graphic design, consider creating icons sets, color
schemes,  sound schemes and logos for KDE. If you enjoy writing we would love
for  you to join our documentation project, KDP.
<P>As you can see there are many
ways in which you can help. You are cordially invited to 
join this world-wide network of people dedicated to making KDE
the best desktop environment for any computer. Please visit 
<A HREF="http://www.kde.org">www.kde.org</A> for more 
information.
<P><B>Welcome aboard on this exciting journey. </B>
<P><CODE>Your KDE Team</CODE>
