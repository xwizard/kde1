<h1>What is KDE?</h1>

<h2>What are we trying to achieve?</h2>

KDE aims to provide a consistent interface to X Window applications in both
appearance and function.  KDE will contain a base set of applications such
as a window manager, filemanager, terminal emulator, help system, and display
configuration.
In addition many standard applications and utilities will be ported to the
KDE system.
This has already started, with ports of ghostview and xdvi already under way.
KDE is <b>not</b> just a window manager which tries to look like another
system.
<p>

<H2>Why do I want KDE?</H2>

KDE is designed for the UNIX newbie, but is configurable, and powerful
enough to satisfy seasoned UNIX users.  It is not a replacement for the
command line.  There will still be occasions when it is better/easier to use
a command line interface - many administration jobs can only be done from the
command line, hence kvt is available :-)  KDE will make UNIX easier to use,
but you should still take the time to learn the basic UNIX commands.
<p>
These are just some of the reasons you might want to use KDE:
<p>
<ul>
<li>You're a UNIX newbie and the amount you don't know is overwhelming.
<li>You're tired of editing configuration files.
<li>You want a consistent interface.
<li>You want an attractive desktop to make your friends with lesser OS's
    jealous.
</ul>
<p>

<H2>What does KDE provide?</H2>

KDE creates a consistent look and feel for applications by specifying a
standard GUI toolkit and support libraries which all KDE applications use,
and a Style Guide which KDE application authors are <em>strongly</em>
encouraged to follow.
<p>
Every KDE application has on-line hypertext help available.  Most
KDE applications will be network aware, allowing transparent ftp and http
access.  All KDE applications are configurable using a graphical interface -
no more text file editing.
<p>
This may not seem any different than several systems/OSs already available,
but it's kinda
new in the free UNIX world, where traditionally more time has been spent
adding features than making it "User Friendly" (maybe rightly so).  Well,
now you can have your friendly applications <b>and</b> a stable OS
to run them on, all for free - now that's a first!
