<h2>Philosophy</h2>

KDE was originally created to make the UNIX desktop more coherent and user
friendly.  This has expanded to include network transparency and world
domination ;-).  The basic objective of all KDE applications is to do one
job very well in the most user friendly and consistent way possible.
<p>

<h2>Launching KDE Applications</h2>

<img src="exec.xpm" align=right>KDE applications are usually launched using KPanel's applications menu.
This menu will automatically contain all KDE applications installed on your
system, plus any other non-KDE applications you wish to make available. For
more information on KPanel view the kpaneluser manual (there is none yet :-( ).
<p>

<h2>The Window Manager</h2>

The window manager (KWM) is the interface you use to move, resize and
close windows.  It also provides the different workspaces and root menus
(the menus that popup when you press a mouse button on the background).
For more detailed information read the <a href="kwm/kwm.html">
kwm user manual</a>.
<p>
more to come...

<h2>The File Manager</h2>

KDE's file manager (KFM) does more than just allow you to move and delete files
and directories - it is the heart of KDE.  The file manager maintains the
desktop icons and provides network services to all other KDE applications.
For more detailed information read the <a href="kfm/kfm.html">
kfm user manual</a>.
