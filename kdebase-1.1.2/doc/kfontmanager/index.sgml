<sect>Introduction
<p>

KFontManager is a font manager for the KDE project. KFontManger was designed
to work in conjunction with kfontdialog version 0.5 and higher.
<p>
The neccessity for a Font-Manager arose from the following facts:

<itemize>
<item>The font-list in kfontdialog used to be hard-coded. This was clearly
not desirable. 
<item>Not all fonts that come with the X11 window system are useful. Were
kfontdialog simply to display all fonts available on your X server system,
you would over and over again be confronted with the same list of fonts,
some of which completely unusable. KFontManger allows you to select which
fonts you want to be available to KDE applications and in particular to
kfontdialog.
</itemize>

<sect>Installation
<p>

You need libkdecore and libqt1.2 in order to be able to compile KFontManager.
To compile and install KFontManger simply execute the following command
at the command-line prompt.

<tscreen><verb>
% ./configure
% make
% make install
</verb></tscreen>

<P>
<sect>How it works
<p>
KFontManager will present to you a list of all available fonts on you
system. You will then use kfontmanger to compose a list of KDE fonts
by choosing those fonts that you like. Your choice 
of fonts will then be available to the KDE applications. 
KFontDialog, which is used in many KDE applications, will then 
offer exactly those fonts
you selected. The list of fonts you create using KFontManager will be stored
in the file ~/.kde/config/kdefonts. Unless you know what you are doing
you should refrain from manipulating the KDE font file by hand.</P>


<sect>For Developers
<p>

A Kapplication method: getKDEFonts(QStrList&nbsp;*fontlist) is availabe 
in KApplication. This method will enable you to obtain the
list of KDE fonts for use in your application, should you have a need for
it. Normally only kfontdialog would do this.
