<P>KDE knows about several types of kdelnk-files and so we have different
types of menu-entries.
<P><B>Submenu:</B>
The submenu is not a kdelnk-file but a directory. So the only attributes
that make sense for a submenu are Name, Icon, MiniIcon and Comment.
<P><B>Separator:</B>
Like the submenu the separator is not a real kdelnk-file, but this fact
makes no difference for the user. Since a separator is just a bar there
are no attributes you may set.
<P><B>Application:</B>
The application type is a real kdelnk-file. Please see the kfm
manual for a detailed description of its attributes.
<P><B>Link:</B>
The link is basically a link to an object in the WWW. Just insert it's
url in the corresponding field.
<P><B>Device:</B>
The device is a kdelnk-file, too. Please see the kfm
manual for details.
<P><B>Swallow:</B>
The swallow type is like an application entry but it is executed in
a different way. You execute it by dropping it onto KPanel to make it a
panel button. KPanel will start the application and swallow its window
into the panel. To find the right window to swallow KPanel needs the title
of the application window. So you have to specify the application you want
to swallow and its title.
As an option you may specify an application to start when you press with
the left mousebutton onto the panel button.
