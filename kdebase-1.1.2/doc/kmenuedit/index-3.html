<P>KMenuedit tries to hide the details of kdelnk-files from the user, so
you don't need to worry if you don't understand the concept behind the
kdelnk-files.
<P>When you start KMenuedit for the first time it will probably ask you
for the basedirectories of your menus. If you don't know what this means
it should be save to say ok to the dialog.
<P>After KMenuedit has started it will show you two menus.
<P>
<IMG SRC="kmenuedit1.gif">
<P>The left menu is your personal menu and the right menu is the system
default menu. Normaly you won't have a personal menu yet, so you will see
a menu with just one entry called 'EMPTY'.
<P>The entries in the right menu are displayed with a gray color because
you don't have write permission to the system default menu. If you start
KMenuedit with sufficient privileges then this menu will be displayed normal
and you may change it.
<P>If you don't like the position of these menus in the window, hold down
the shift key and the middle mouse button and move the menu arround. The
position of the base menus will be saved for the next time you start KMenuedit.
<P>There are several ways to <CODE>add</CODE> an entry to a menu:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Drag a kdelnk-file or any executable with kfm and drop it on a menu.</LI>
<LI>Press the right mouse button on a menuentry and select 'New' from the
popupmenu.</LI>
<LI>Drag a menuentry from another menu and drop it on the menu.</LI>
</UL>
<P>To <EM>open a submenu</EM>, select 'Open/ Close' from the popupmenu or
click with the left mouse button on the menuentry. Do just the same to
<EM>close the submenu</EM>. Note that closing a submenu closes all of it's
submenus, too.
<P>You may even use <EM>cut, copy</EM> and <EM>paste</EM> with menuentries by selecting
the correspondig option in the popupmenu. Just select 'copy' on one menuentry
and select 'paste' on another entry to insert the copied menuentry below
this entry.
<P>To <EM>move</EM> an entry to another position within it's menu, hold down
the middle mouse button on this entry and move it around.
<P>To insert an new <EM>seperator</EM> or <EM>submenu</EM> select 'New' from
the popupmenu and 
<A HREF="#change">change</A> the new entry.
<P>If you exit KMenuedit before saving no changes will be written to disk
and if you want to discard all changes without restarting KMenuedit, just
press the reload button.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="change"></A> <A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 Changing menu entries</A>
</H3>

<P>To change a menuentry select 'Change' from its popupmenu. You will be
presented the following dialog.
<P>
<IMG SRC="kmenuedit2.gif">
<P>The combobox in the first line selects the type of the menu entry. To
see a description of the various types see 
<A HREF="index-4.html#file-types">Types</A>.
<P>The next lines specify various attributes that are common to most menuentries.
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>FileName:</B> The filename of the kdelnk-file.</LI>
<LI><B>Name:</B> The name of the menuentry.</LI>
<LI><B>MiniIcon:</B> The small icon shown by kpanel.</LI>
<LI><B>Comment:</B> The descriptive text displayed by kpanel and kfm.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Due to the fact that any menuentry is saved into a seperate kdelnk-file
each file needs a unique name inside its submenu. If you don't specify
a filename, KMenuedit will create its own filename.
<P>If you want to change the icons, just click on the icon and select the
new icon from a dialog.
<P>The attributes within the tab-dialog are type specific and are described
in 
<A HREF="index-4.html#file-types">Entry Types</A>.
