gives a tab dialog with five pages dealing with different aspects of the
desktop display.

<enum>
<item>The desktop <bf>Background</bf>.
<item>The <bf>Screen Saver</bf>.
<item>The desktop <bf>Color Scheme</bf>.
<item>The desktop <bf>Fonts</bf>.
<item>The desktop <bf>Style</bf> choices.
</enum>

Running <verb>kcmdisplay -init</verb> simply applies your preferences to the
desktop.

<sect>Background
<p>

The Background setup dialog is comprised of four sections:

<enum>
<item>Selection of the <bf>Desktop</bf> to configure.
<item>The background <bf>Preview Monitor</bf>.
<item>The background <bf>Color</bf>.
<item>The background <bf>Wallpaper</bf>.
</enum>

At the bottom of the screen the
option <bf>Dock into the panel</bf>
allows you to select whether an icon for
the Background  Display Setting dialog is docked into the Panel
(this provides quick access to the Display Settings menu,
and also allows stepping through changing background
sequences  when the ``<bf>Random</bf>'' background mode option
is selected).

Also at the bottom of the screen is a slider
allowing the  memory <bf>Cache size</bf> used by the display to
be adjusted.


<sect1>Selection of the Desktop to configure.
<p>
The top left <bf>Desktop</bf> box lists the 
currently-configured desktops by their assigned names.
Click on a name to select the corresponding desktop to
be configured.   

If you wish to configure a common background for
all Desktops, select  the <bf>Common Background</bf>
option.

<sect1>Preview Monitor

<p>

This is a minature representation of your display background, using the
current settings.  To apply these settings to your display, press the
<bf>Apply</bf> button to continue using the KDE display setup utility, or the
<bf>Ok</bf> button to apply your changes and quit.

<p>

<em>Note:</em> Pressing <bf>Ok</bf> or <bf>Apply</bf> applies changes made in
<em>all</em> of the display setup modules.

<sect1>Background Color

<p>

The display background can be filled with a single color or with a color
gradient.

<p>

<itemize>
<item>
Select ``<bf>One Color</bf>'' to fill the background with a single color.
The background color can be changed by clicking on the colored box which
shows the currently-selected color.
This will display a color selection dialog from which
you may select a new background color.
<item>
Select ``<bf>Two Color</bf>''
to fill the background with a color gradient or pattern,
A second colored box will appear. 
Click on this box to select the second color.
Now click on the <bf>Setup</bf> button to choose how to
blend the two colors. A dialog and Preview box will appear.
You may choose to progressively blend the colors from 
<bf>top to bottom</bf> of the screen, from <bf>right to left</bf>, 
or in a <bf>pattern</bf> selected
from the list shown.   You will see a preview of the choice you make
before you apply it. Click <bf>OK</bf> or <bf>Cancel</bf> to leave
this dialog.
</itemize>


When you are happy with your color selection, press <bf>Ok</bf> in the color
selection dialog.  The colors will be updated in the colored
boxes (and in the Preview
Monitor,  provided no Wallpaper is selected).
<p>


<p>
A blend of the two colors uses only 8 colors, leaving plenty free for other
applications. However, it requires an image the size of your display to be
maintained in memory.

<sect1>Wallpaper

<p>

The wallpaper is an image displayed in the background (root window) of your
display.  To change the wallpaper displayed, select one from the list
or click the <bf>Browse</bf> button and select an image.  If wish to
use a One Color or Two Color background, choose <tt>No Wallpaper</tt>. 

<p>
Choose from the <bf>Arrangement</bf> list to select how the
wallpaper image is applied to the desktop: various tiling, mirroring, or
scaling schemes are possible, and their effects may be seen in 
the Preview box.

<p>
You may also select the  <bf>Random</bf> option
which causes a random sequence
of backgrounds to be displayed, changing after a specified time
interval, or when you click on the  Display icon docked in the panel.

 To configure the random sequence of backgrounds:
<itemize>
<item> 
 Click on the <bf>Setup</bf> button to open the
<bf>Random mode setup</bf> dialog, which allows you to select 
the sequence of backgrounds which is sampled.
<item>
If the option <bf>Pick files from directory</bf> is
selected, the backgrounds wil be
chosen from the set of wallpaper files in the selected directory
entered in the box that opens.
If this option is <bf>not</bf> selected, they will
be chosen from a list of backgrounds that can be specified in
the ``<bf>Desktops</bf>''  box below.
<item>
The <bf>Timer Delay in seconds </bf> box allows you to set
the time interval  between background changes.  

<item>Select the ``<bf>in order</bf>'' option to display
the sequence of backgrounds in order.  If this option is not
active, the sequence will be sampled randomly.

<item> The ``<bf>Desktops</bf>'' box contains the user-specified
sequence of  backgrounds that will be sampled if the ``<bf>pick files
from directory</bf>'' option is <it>not</it> active.
<itemize>
<item>
Click on an entry to highlight it; it will be
previewed in the main Background dialog Preview Monitor.  
<item>
Click on <bf>Add</bf> To add an entry to this sequence.
This will open a  dialog which
allows you to choose a Wallpaper file.
(Initially, the contents of the KDE default wallpaper directory are
displayed, but you may change
to other directories).  
Select a file, and click on ``OK''. If your choice
is valid, it will be added to the sequence.
<item>
Click on <bf>Delete</bf> to remove the highlighted
item from the Random Mode backgrounds sequence.
</itemize>
In this way, you can construct any sequence of backgrounds
you wish.  Click on <bf>OK</bf> when you are satisfied with it.
</itemize>


<p>
Displaying wallpaper requires that the image be kept in memory.  If you are low
on memory, using a small, tiled image or none at all is recommended. Note
that scaling or centering a small image still requires an image the size of
your display to be maintained in memory.



<sect>Screen Saver
<p>

The Screen Saver setup dialog is comprised of three sections:

<enum>
<item>The screen saver <bf>Preview Monitor</bf>.
<item>The  choice of <bf>Screen Saver</bf> program to run.
<item>The global screen saver <bf>Settings</bf>.



</enum>

<sect1>Preview Monitor
<p>

This is a minature representation of your screen saver, using the current
settings.  
To apply these settings to your display, press the <bf>Apply</bf>
button to continue using the KDE display setup utility or <bf>Ok</bf> button
to apply your changes and quit.

<p>

In the corners of this monitor are four grey boxes.  These boxes indicate
what action to take if the cursor is left in one of the corners for more than
5 seconds.  The options are:

<itemize>
<item><bf>Ignore</bf> - take no action
<item><bf>Save Screen</bf> - invoke the screen saver
<item><bf>Lock Screen</bf> - lock the screen
</itemize>

To select an option, place the mouse over a grey box, and right-click;
make your choice in the dialog box that opens. If the Save or Lock
option is selected, this
is shown in the corresponding grey box: ("s" = Save, "l" = Lock). 


<p>
<em>Note:</em> Pressing <bf>Ok</bf> or <bf>Apply</bf> applies changes made in
<em>all</em> of the display setup modules.

<sect1>Screen Saver
<p>

Choose the particular screen saver program that runs from the list.  
The working screen saver will
be shown in minature in the preview monitor.
(<tt>No screensaver</tt> is the default.)
<p>

Most screen savers have settings which can be changed by clicking the
<bf>Setup...</bf> button.  This will display a dialog specific to the
currently selected screen saver.

<p>

The <bf>Test</bf> button runs the screen saver immediately, full screen,
for a short interval.


<sect1>Settings
<p>

Enter the time (in minutes) without activity to wait before the screen saver
is invoked.

<p>

Selecting the <bf>Requires Password</bf> option
will make the screen saver prompt you for
your password before restoring the screen.
<p>
Select the  <bf>Show password as stars</bf> option
for the screensaver password box
to show the number of characters typed.


<p>

The <bf>Priority</bf> slider sets the priority 
of the screen saver 
relative to other running processes.




<sect>Color Scheme
<p>

The Color Scheme setup dialog is comprised of three sections:

<enum>
<item>The color scheme <bf>Preview</bf>.
<item>The available <bf>Color Schemes</bf>.
<item>The choice of <bf>Widget Color</bf>.
</enum>

(The term "<bf>Widget</bf>" 
means an element of the
User Interface such as a button, menu, scroll bar, etc. )

<sect1>Preview
<p>

This section of the dialog demonstrates how a color scheme applies to a
sample selection of widgets. A color scheme consists of a set of twelve
colors. These colors apply to the  following elements:

<itemize>
<item><bf>Inactive window</bf>: title bar text, background and blend.
<item><bf>Active window</bf>: title bar text, background and blend
<item><bf>General</bf>: text and background
<item><bf>Selected</bf>: text and background
<item><bf>Window</bf>: text and background
</itemize>

Labels on the sample widgets identify most of these 
locations. If you click on any object in the preview
box, the corresponding color scheme element will be
named  in the  box in the <bf>Widget color</bf> section.

<p>

The colors are grouped into 5 text/background pairs. Thus, good
contrast between the text and background colors of widgets can be
ensured at all times.

<p>

When you press <bf>Ok</bf> or <bf>Apply</bf> the color scheme you have selected
will be written to the desktop configuration.  

<p>
<em>Note:</em> Pressing <bf>Ok</bf> or <bf>Apply</bf> applies changes made in
<em>all</em> of the display setup modules.


<sect1>Color schemes
<p>

Various color schemes are supplied with KDE. These include:
<it>
KDE default, 
Atlas green,
BeOS,
Blue slate,
CDE,
Desert red,
Digital CDE,
Pale gray,
Pumpkin,
Solaris CDE,
Storm,</it>
and <it>Windows 95</it>.
To preview a scheme click on its name in the list box. 

<p>
You can use the
KDE-supplied Color Schemes as a starting point to devise your own
Scheme. Click on the 
<bf>Add</bf> button to store the color scheme from the
Preview under a new name, then modify it. When such a user-created
Color Scheme is selected, changes to it (as shown
in the Preview) can be  saved
with the <bf>Save Changes</bf> button; it can also be
deleted with the 
<bf>Remove</bf> button.

The KDE-supplied Schemes themselves cannot be changed or deleted.


<sect1>Widget Color
<p>

The currently selected element of the color scheme is shown in 
the <bf>Widget Color</bf> group. The color can be changed by clicking on 
the
colored box. A color selection dialog will then appear, from which you may
select any desired color.
<p>

When you are happy with your color selection, press <bf>Ok</bf> in the color
selection dialog.  The color will be updated in the <bf>Preview</bf>.

<p>
<p>
The <bf>Contrast</bf> slider allows you to change the contrast between
different shadings of the selected colors.



<sect>Fonts
<p>

You may change the font and character set  for the desktop.  
These fonts will be used by KDE applications, and 
(if ``<bf>Apply fonts and colors to non-KDE apps</bf>''
is selected in the Desktop <bf>Style</bf> settings)
by selected non-KDE
applications.

You may need to restart KDE for
font changes to be fully applied  to all KDE 
applications.


Click on a Font category in the main list to select it
(This lists various categories of KDE functions for which
a font must be defined: General font, Fixed font, etc.). 

For each category,
select a <bf>Typeface</bf> from the list,
optionally choose <bf>Bold</bf> or <bf>Italic</bf>,  
and select the typeface size by clicking
on "+" or "-" buttons at the right of the <bf>Size</bf> box.
You may also choose the <bf>Character Set</bf> for this font (the choices
available depend on the Typeface chosen). The choices 
<tt>default</tt> 
and <tt>any</tt> are always available.
(The Default Character Set is configured in the File Manager Font menu).

The font you have selected is previewed in the 
<bf>Sample text</bf> box.


To restore the KDE default configuration, click on the <bf>Default</bf>
button at the bottom of the screen.  Click on <bf>Apply</bf> or
<bf>OK</bf> to activate your choice.  

<p>
<em>Note:</em> Pressing <bf>Ok</bf> or <bf>Apply</bf> applies changes made in
<em>all</em> of the display setup modules.


<sect>Style
<p>

The Style dialog allows three Desktop style choices to be made, and
the icon style (``normal'' or ``large'') to be selected.

<itemize>
<item> <bf>Draw widgets in the  style of Windows 95</bf>.  
Select this option
for a Windows95/98(tm) style for the KDE Desktop widgets.
If this option is not selected, they will have a Motif(tm)
style.
For example, the widget  that chooses this option
is a button in Motif style, and a check box in
Windows 95 style.

<item> <bf>Menubar on top of the screen in the style of MacOS</bf>.
This option emulates the MacOS style by placing a menubar for
the currently-active application at the top of the screen.
 

<item> <bf>Apply fonts and colors to non-KDE apps</bf>.
Selecting this option allows the "look and feel"
of KDE applications (mainly fonts and colors) to also be applied to 
certain non-KDE X11 applications such as Emacs and XEmacs.  
</itemize>


Note: The ``<bf>Apply fonts and colors to non-KDE apps</bf>'' 
feature uses <tt>krdb</tt>, KDE's
interface to <tt>xrdb</tt>, the X-resources database.  If this
causes you to experience problems with your non-KDE applications, 
you may wish to deactivate this feature.
A change of this selection  may not take effect until KDE is
restarted.


The <bf>Icon style</bf> section allows you to
choose between ``<bf>normal</bf>'' and ``<bf>large</bf>'' style
icons.  You may make this choice separately for icons
used in the <bf>Panel</bf>,
<bf>File manager and desktop icons</bf>,
and <bf>Other</bf> icons.
<itemize>
<item> <bf>Note:</bf> The <bf>Panel Icon Style</bf> controls the size of the
Panel.   For more complete configuration, including the choice
of ``<bf>tiny</bf>'' style icons for the Panel, use the panel configuration
dialog (select ``Configure'' in the Panel menu, or go to the 
``Applications -> Panel'' configuration menu).
</itemize>


<p>
To restore the KDE default configuration, click on the <bf>Default</bf>
button at the bottom of the screen.  Click on <bf>Apply</bf> or
<bf>OK</bf> to activate your choice.  

<p>
<em>Note:</em> Pressing <bf>Ok</bf> or <bf>Apply</bf> applies changes made in
<em>all</em> of the display setup modules.
