<sect>Configuring the Keyboard
<p>
In this dialog, users can adjust the following settings for the keyboard:

<itemize>
<item><bf>Keyboard repeat</bf>: If Keyboard repeat is
<bf>On</bf>, the <bf>autorepeat</bf> feature is enabled:
this causes holding down a key to become equivalent to
typing it over and over again in rapid succession.
This featue is disabled when Keyboard Repeat is <bf>Off</bf>.

<item>The <bf>key click volume</bf> is controlled by
a slider. This feature gives audible feedback to the
typist when a key is struck.
</itemize>

Note: Keyboard settings are managed by  the X server.
While the X server attempts to make good use of the available hardware,
this is not always possible. 
For example, on some systems the key click is enabled
or disabled in the CMOS setup and the X server cannot supply an
alternative. Thus, if a setting does not seem to do anything, it is 
probably because that feaure is unsupported by
the X server and/or the hardware.




<sect>Configuring the Mouse

<p>
In this dialog, users can adjust the <bf>Accelerated mode</bf> settings for 
the mouse, and adjust the mappings of the mouse buttons for
right-handed or left-handed use.

<itemize>
<item>
In  <bf>accelerated mode</bf>, 
the distance on the screen moved by the pointer for a given movement of the
pointing device (e.g., the mouse) is increased by a factor
called the
<bf>Acceleration</bf>, which is set by the first slider control.
<item>
The mouse will go into accelerated mode
if the pointer is made to  make  a rapid movement on the screen
larger than
the  <bf>Threshold</bf> distance set with the second slider control.
</itemize>

This acceleration feature allows for slow, 
precise pointer motion over small distances and rapid motion across 
the screen with a short but quick motion of the mouse.
Large acceleration
values and small threshold values may make the pointer motion
too jerky
to be useful, as it will always move very quickly.
<p>

The <bf>button mapping</bf> selection allows the functions of the right
and left mouse buttons to be swapped.
<itemize>
<item>
The <bf>Right handed</bf> choice gives the normal mouse button scheme,

<item>The <bf>Left handed</bf> choice gives the reversed-button scheme,
for the convenience of left-handed users.
</itemize>
