<H3><A NAME="s1">1. Setting the Language</A></H3>

<P>
<P>With this dialog, you can set the language that is used by KDE. You can
choose up to three languages. If you start a program, KDE tries to find a
translation of the program's dialogs and messages into the first language. 
If this fails,
it looks for the second language, then the third. If it cannot find any of
the three, the default language is used (usually English.)
<P>
<P>The search for up to three languages allows you to set preferences. You might
want to see the messages in Spanish, but if this is not available, 
you might prefer
French and, if that is not available,   German , rather than English.
In this case, choose
<UL>
<LI><B>First</B> language: <CODE>Spanish</CODE></LI>
<LI><B>Second</B> language: <CODE>French</CODE></LI>
<LI><B>Third</B> language: <CODE>German</CODE></LI>
</UL>
<P>There is a substantial ``internationalization'' effort 
to translate messages from
KDE programs into many languages.
If translations into your language are not yet available, or are
incorrect, please consider volunteering to help the KDE
translation team! 
<P>
<P>Setting or changing the languages will not affect the programs that are
already running. Only programs started after the change will be translated
according to your new preferences. 
To change the language for all programs on the screen, you will
have to  exit KDE and restart it.
