<P>
<P>The <B>Active desktop borders</B> feature allows you to change to an adjacent
desktop by bringing the mouse pointer to the edge of the screen, and keeping it
there for a specified time.  The relative positions of the desktops are the
same as the arrangement of buttons of the Panel that select them: for example,
placing the pointer on the right side of the screen causes a jump to the next
desktop to the right, unless the current desktop is the last one on the
right, in which case the jump is back to the leftmost desktop.  When
active desktop borders are activated, you may also
drag a window with you as you move between desktops.
<P>
<P>Select <B>Enable active desktop borders</B> to turn this feature on.
<P>
<P>If the feature is activated, you can select <B>Move pointer towards center
after switch</B> to cause the pointer to jump directly to the center of 
the new desktop when such a change takes place.
<P>To guard against unwanted jumps between desktops, you can set
the <B>Desktop switch delay</B> which specifies how long
(in seconds)  the
pointer must remain at the edge of the screen for this to be
interpreted as a desktop switch command.
<P>
<P>The <B>Magic Borders</B> settings allow a <B>snap zone</B>
measured in pixels to be set.   The edge of the screen is surrounded by
the <B>Border Snap Zone</B>, and the edge of any window is surrounded
by the <B>Window Snap Zone</B>. If you move the edge of a  window into
the snap zone of the edge of the screen or of another window, the window that
is being moved will jump
("snap") so its edge is in direct contact with that edge.
