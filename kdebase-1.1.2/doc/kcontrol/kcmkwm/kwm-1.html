<H3><A NAME="s1">1. Configuring Window Management Options.</A></H3>

<P>The Window  Manager Options screen allows configuration
of  three distinct properties:
<P>
<OL>
<LI> Appearance of <B>Windows</B> while being moved or resized.</LI>
<LI> Window <B>Placement Policy</B>.</LI>
<LI> Window <B>Focus policy</B>.</LI>
</OL>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 Appearance of moving and resizing <B>Windows</B></A>
</H3>

<P>If <B>Vertical maximization only  by default</B> is selected,
windows will expand vertically to the full height of the screen if
the maximization button is clicked, but their width will not change.
(If this option is <B>not</B> selected, the width will also
expand to fill the screen).
<P>
<P>If <B>Display content in moving windows</B> is selected,
the content of a moving window will move as the window is moved
("opaque" motion).
If this option is <B>not</B> selected, only an empty
"wireframe" representation of the window will be seen moving;
the content of the window will remain at the original location
until the motion is finished, at which time it will suddenly jump to
its new location ("transparent"  motion).
<P>
<P>The <B>Display content in resizing windows</B> is 
similar to the previous option: if selected, a window
will behave in an "opaque" manner while being resized;
otherwise, it will behave in a "transparent" manner.
<P>
<P>The <B>Resize animation</B> slider controls whether, and how fast,
an animated representation of the window expands or contracts
when a window maximization of minimization button is clicked.
If the slider control is set to its leftmost postion, the size change
will be instantaneous; otherwise, the slider controls the speed
of the change.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss1.2">1.2 Window <B>Placement Policy</B>.</A>
</H3>

<P>Any of five different Window placement policies may be selected
from the list box.   These determine where a new window will
be placed on the desktop when it is first opened.   
<P>
<UL>
<LI> The "<B>smart</B>" placement policy implements an
automatic scheme designed to produce minimal
cluttering of the desktop. It acts independently on each desk.
(<I>Recommended</I>).
</LI>
<LI> The "<B>random</B>" placement policy places newly-created windows
at a random place on the desktop.

</LI>
<LI> The "<B>cascade</B>" placement acts somewhat similar to the 
"random" placement, but it is more consistent in the choice of the 
window position and keeps track of available "cascaded" positions for
each desktop separately. 
 </LI>
<LI> The "<B>manual</B>" placement creates a window 
that moves with the mouse
pointer until placed down by clicking a mouse button.
</LI>
<LI> The "<B>interactive</B>" placement policy is a cross between the
"smart" and the "manual" policies: in this case the window placement
is automatic if the windows can be placed without overlapping
each other "too much", otherwise the placement policy becomes
manual.  The "<B>allowed overlap</B>" is set in the box that opens
when this selection is made.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss1.3">1.3 Window <B>Focus policy</B>.</A>
</H3>

<P>The window that is "in focus" receives keyboard input and has the
active titlebar appearance (usually colored instead of gray). The
focus can be switched to another window with the keyboard (Alt+Tab)
or the mouse.   The <B>Focus policy</B> determines which window
is in focus at a given time.  When the focus policy follows the KDE
style, the Alt+Tab key combination allows the focus to be transferred
between windows on a graphical listing of the open windows.
<P>
<UL>
<LI> If <B>click to focus</B> (KDE style)
is selected, the user must click the mouse
inside a window to raise it to the front and give it the focus. 
</LI>
<LI>If <B>Focus follows mouse</B> (KDE style)
is selected, the focus switches to a window as soon as the pointer
enters it. This makes focus switching without raising a window easier,
but with the disadvantage that the position of the pointer is important even
when the pointer isn't being used. The window remains in focus until the
mouse pointer enters another window, to which focus then passes, so
some window is always in focus.

</LI>
<LI> The <B>Classic sloppy focus</B> policy is similar to
the "Focus follows mouse" policy, except that the action of the
Alt+Tab key combination switches the focus directly between windows
in the CDE desktop style, rather than in the graphical KDE style.


</LI>
<LI> The <B>Classic focus follows mouse</B>  policy is a  similar
CDE-style policy, except that
the window loses  focus as soon as the mouse pointer leaves it.
If the mouse pointer is not in any window, (for example, is on the desktop
background or Panel), <B>no</B> window is in focus.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<P>Selection of the <B>Auto Raise</B> feature 
serves to raise a window to the front (top) when it gets the
focus. If a <B>delay</B> in milliseconds is set using the slider control,
the window is only raised if the mouse is still inside the window
after a period equal to this delay has elapsed since focus passed to it.
(This does not apply when the "click to focus" policy is in force). 
<P>
<P>Selection of the <B>Click Raise</B> feature allows a window
to be raised to the front by clicking the mouse anywhere inside it.
If this feature is not selected, only a click on a window's
titlebar will raise it to the front.
(This does not apply when the "click to focus" policy is in force).
