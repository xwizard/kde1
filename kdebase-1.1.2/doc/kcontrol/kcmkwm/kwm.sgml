<sect>Configuring Window Management Options.
<p>
The Window  Manager Options screen allows configuration
of  three distinct properties:
 
<enum>
<item> Appearance of <bf>Windows</bf> while being moved or resized.
<item> Window <bf>Placement Policy</bf>.
<item> Window <bf>Focus policy</bf>.
</enum>

<sect1> Appearance of moving and resizing <bf>Windows</bf>
<p>
If <bf>Vertical maximization only  by default</bf> is selected,
windows will expand vertically to the full height of the screen if
the maximization button is clicked, but their width will not change.
(If this option is <bf>not</bf> selected, the width will also
expand to fill the screen).

<p>
If <bf>Display content in moving windows</bf> is selected,
the content of a moving window will move as the window is moved
("opaque" motion).
If this option is <bf>not</bf> selected, only an empty
"wireframe" representation of the window will be seen moving;
the content of the window will remain at the original location
until the motion is finished, at which time it will suddenly jump to
its new location ("transparent"  motion).

<p>
The <bf>Display content in resizing windows</bf> is 
similar to the previous option: if selected, a window
will behave in an "opaque" manner while being resized;
otherwise, it will behave in a "transparent" manner.

<p>
The <bf>Resize animation</bf> slider controls whether, and how fast,
an animated representation of the window expands or contracts
when a window maximization of minimization button is clicked.
If the slider control is set to its leftmost postion, the size change
will be instantaneous; otherwise, the slider controls the speed
of the change.

<sect1> Window <bf>Placement Policy</bf>.
<p>
Any of five different Window placement policies may be selected
from the list box.   These determine where a new window will
be placed on the desktop when it is first opened.   

<itemize>
<item> The "<bf>smart</bf>" placement policy implements an
automatic scheme designed to produce minimal
cluttering of the desktop. It acts independently on each desk.
(<it>Recommended</it>).

<item> The "<bf>random</bf>" placement policy places newly-created windows
at a random place on the desktop.


<item> The "<bf>cascade</bf>" placement acts somewhat similar to the 
"random" placement, but it is more consistent in the choice of the 
window position and keeps track of available "cascaded" positions for
each desktop separately. 
 
<item> The "<bf>manual</bf>" placement creates a window 
that moves with the mouse
pointer until placed down by clicking a mouse button.

<item> The "<bf>interactive</bf>" placement policy is a cross between the
"smart" and the "manual" policies: in this case the window placement
is automatic if the windows can be placed without overlapping
each other "too much", otherwise the placement policy becomes
manual.  The "<bf>allowed overlap</bf>" is set in the box that opens
when this selection is made.

</itemize>

<sect1> Window <bf>Focus policy</bf>.
<p>
The window that is "in focus" receives keyboard input and has the
active titlebar appearance (usually colored instead of gray). The
focus can be switched to another window with the keyboard (Alt+Tab)
or the mouse.   The <bf>Focus policy</bf> determines which window
is in focus at a given time.  When the focus policy follows the KDE
style, the Alt+Tab key combination allows the focus to be transferred
between windows on a graphical listing of the open windows.

<itemize>
<item> If <bf>click to focus</bf> (KDE style)
is selected, the user must click the mouse
inside a window to raise it to the front and give it the focus. 

<item>If <bf>Focus follows mouse</bf> (KDE style)
is selected, the focus switches to a window as soon as the pointer
enters it. This makes focus switching without raising a window easier,
but with the disadvantage that the position of the pointer is important even
when the pointer isn't being used. The window remains in focus until the
mouse pointer enters another window, to which focus then passes, so
some window is always in focus.


<item> The <bf>Classic sloppy focus</bf> policy is similar to
the "Focus follows mouse" policy, except that the action of the
Alt+Tab key combination switches the focus directly between windows
in the CDE desktop style, rather than in the graphical KDE style.



<item> The <bf>Classic focus follows mouse</bf>  policy is a  similar
CDE-style policy, except that
the window loses  focus as soon as the mouse pointer leaves it.
If the mouse pointer is not in any window, (for example, is on the desktop
background or Panel), <bf>no</bf> window is in focus.

</itemize>

<p>
Selection of the <bf>Auto Raise</bf> feature 
serves to raise a window to the front (top) when it gets the
focus. If a <bf>delay</bf> in milliseconds is set using the slider control,
the window is only raised if the mouse is still inside the window
after a period equal to this delay has elapsed since focus passed to it.
(This does not apply when the "click to focus" policy is in force). 

<p>
Selection of the <bf>Click Raise</bf> feature allows a window
to be raised to the front by clicking the mouse anywhere inside it.
If this feature is not selected, only a click on a window's
titlebar will raise it to the front.
(This does not apply when the "click to focus" policy is in force). 


<sect>Configuring the titlebar buttons

<p>
This dialog configures the placement of up to five buttons in the titlebars,
with the listed button functions (<bf>Minimize</bf>, <bf> Maximize</bf>,
<bf>Sticky</bf>, <bf>Close</bf>, and <bf>Menu</bf>) and 
corresponding button symbols. 
Each button can be placed
on the <bf>left</bf>, on the <bf>right</bf>, or switched <bf>off</bf>
(not placed in the tiitlebar).

The ``<bf>Sticky</bf>'' button allows a window to ``stick'', or remain in its
place, if the user switches to another desktop.

<p>
The placement of buttons on each side of the titlebar follows a simple
rule: buttons which are higher up in the list appear <em>inside</em>
or near the middle of the window relative to buttons that are farther
down on the list. This allows for most sensible button arrangements.

<p>
Since a maximum of three (3) buttons are allowed on each side of the
titlebar, trying to place a fourth button on either side will cause the
innermost one to be switched off.

The titlebar image shown on this screen previews how the buttons
will be placed if the chosen placement is applied.


<sect>Configuring the titlebar appearance and action
<p>

With this dialog, you can change the visual appearance 
of the titlebar and partially choose how it acts..

<p>
The <bf>Title Alignment</bf> selection sets the position of the window
title in the titlebar. The choices are <bf>left</bf>, <bf>middle</bf>,
or <bf>right</bf> (left-justified, centered, or right-justified)

<p>
There is a choice between
four  options for the titlebar <bf>Appearance</bf>:

<itemize>
<item> <bf>Shaded Vertically</bf>: fills the bar with a color gradient from 
top to bottom
<item> <bf>Shaded Horizontally</bf>: fills the bar with a color gradient from side to
side
<item> <bf>Plain</bf>: fills the bar with a simple color
<item> <bf>Pixmap</bf>: allows you to select pixmaps which are 
tiled to fill the
titlebar; in this case click on the <bf>Active pixmap</bf> and
<bf>Inactive pixmap</bf> buttons to select different pixmaps for the 
titlebars of active
and inactive windows.  You may also choose not to
extend the pixmap tiling under the text on the titlebar.
</itemize>

If the ``<bf>Active title has shaded frame</bf>'' box is checked,
the titlebar of the active window has a shadowed,
slightly  three-dimensional
look.

<p>
The <bf>Mouse action</bf>  section lets you choose what happens when you 
doubleclick
on the titlebar of a window with the left mouse button. 
Possible choices are:
<itemize>
<item>
<bf>(Un)Maximize</bf> : double-click to maximize the window, double-click
again to unmaximize.
<item>
<bf>(Un)Shade</bf>: double-click to hide all parts of the window
except the titlebar, double-click again to restore it (somewhat
like the action of roller-blind window shades).  This
is the default behavior. 
<item>
<bf>Iconify</bf>: Window is shrunk to an entry on the Taskbar.
<item><bf>(Un)Sticky</bf>: double-click to change between ``sticky''
and ``not sticky'' window attribute.
<item><bf>Close</bf>: Window is closed.
</itemize>
 
<p>
If the  window title is too long to be completely
displayed on the window titlebar, 
the "<bf>Title animation</bf>" option allows the text to slide
back and forth, so all of the title can be read.
The slider bar controls the period of this motion; setting the period
to 0 switches off this feature.





<sect> Configuring Desktop Border Properties
<p>

The <bf>Active desktop borders</bf> feature allows you to change to an adjacent
desktop by bringing the mouse pointer to the edge of the screen, and keeping it
there for a specified time.  The relative positions of the desktops are the
same as the arrangement of buttons of the Panel that select them: for example,
placing the pointer on the right side of the screen causes a jump to the next
desktop to the right, unless the current desktop is the last one on the
right, in which case the jump is back to the leftmost desktop.  When
active desktop borders are activated, you may also
drag a window with you as you move between desktops.

<p>
Select <bf>Enable active desktop borders</bf> to turn this feature on.

<p>
If the feature is activated, you can select <bf>Move pointer towards center
after switch</bf> to cause the pointer to jump directly to the center of 
the new desktop when such a change takes place.
<p>
To guard against unwanted jumps between desktops, you can set
the <bf>Desktop switch delay</bf> which specifies how long
(in seconds)  the
pointer must remain at the edge of the screen for this to be
interpreted as a desktop switch command.
<p>

The <bf>Magic Borders</bf> settings allow a <bf>snap zone</bf>
measured in pixels to be set.   The edge of the screen is surrounded by
the <bf>Border Snap Zone</bf>, and the edge of any window is surrounded
by the <bf>Window Snap Zone</bf>. If you move the edge of a  window into
the snap zone of the edge of the screen or of another window, the window that
is being moved will jump
("snap") so its edge is in direct contact with that edge.


<sect> Configuring Mouse Button Actions
<p>
This screen allows you to configure the actions of clicks
of the three mouse buttons while the pointer is over a window.

The <bf>Titlebar and frame</bf> settings allow configuration of
the action of mouse button clicks while the pointer is over
the titlebar of either <bf>Active</bf> windows (with focus)
or <bf>Inactive</bf> windows (without focus).  Choose the
possible actions from those in the list boxes.

The <bf>Inactive inner window</bf> settings configure
the action of mouse clicks when the pointer is over the
interior of an inactive window.


The  final <bf>Inner window, titlebar and frame</bf>
settings configure the action of clicking the mouse 
buttons <bf>while the Alt key is held down</bf>,
when the pointer is over any part of a window, whether
active or not.


<sect> Advanced Window Manager Settings.
<p>
This screen allows you to configure various
advanced Window Manager features.

In the <bf>Keyboard and Mouse</bf> settings:
<itemize>
<item>If <bf>Ctrl-Tab walks through desktops</bf> is selected,
this key combination can be used to switch desktops.
<item> The Alt+Tab key combination is used to switch focus
between different windows, making each window active in turn.  
If <bf>Alt-Tab is limited to current desktop</bf> is selected,
only the open windows in the current desktop will be
cycled through.   Using the <bf>Alt-Tab mode</bf>
list box, the action of the Alt-Tab key can be chosen to
be in the graphical KDE style, or the "Classic" CDE style. 
The KDE-style Alt-Tab mode assures that using successive isolated Alt-Tab
key combination will permit to switch between two alternate windows.
Keeping the Alt key pressed and consecutively pressing Tab will allow
to browse the list of available windows. The CDE-style Alt-Tab mode
is different in the way isolated Alt-Tab presses act. Windows are always
browsed successively.

<item> The <bf>Grab the Right Mouse Button</bf> setting is <bf>on</bf>
by default. This option was introduced because a number of non-KDE X Window
applications need to have complete control of the use of the right mouse
button (for example Gimp).  Deselect this option to allow non-KDE
X Window applications to control the right mouse button.

</itemize>

The ``<bf>Filters</bf>'' section allows windows 
with specified <bf>Titles</bf> or belonging to
specified <bf>Classes</bf> to be configured
differently from the default window configuration.


<itemize>
<item> The <bf>window Title</bf> is its title, as  displayed in the titlebar.
<item> The <bf>window Class</bf> is its ``X class name'', which is
derived from the name of the program that is running in the window.
Usually the X class name is the program name with the first letter
capitalized (e.g., ``<tt>Emacs</tt>'' is the X class name of a window
running the ``<tt>emacs</tt>'' program), except that
if the program name begins with ``x'',
the  first <bf>two</bf> letters are usuallly
capitalized (e.g.., ``<tt>XTerm</tt>'' is the X class name of 
an ``<tt>xterm</tt>'' window).
</itemize>


Windows that have  <bf>Titles</bf>
or belong to <bf>Classes</bf> that match a list item can have one of these 
special properties: they can be configured so these <bf>Windows will</bf>
<itemize>
<item>have only tiny decorations,
<item>have no decorations,
<item>never gain focus,
<item>start as ``Sticky'',
<item>be excluded from session management.
</itemize>
Separate lists  are maintained for each ``special property'', and
a given Title or Class may belong to more than one such list.

To <bf>add</bf> an entry to one of the lists, select
the  corresponding ``special property'' from the ``<bf>Windows will</bf>'' 
pull-down menu, and then
enter a Title or Class  in the appropriate
``<bf>if they match the following</bf>''
box, and click on the "<bf>+</bf>" button to add it to the list. 
Note that a <it>partial match</it> will select the property (e.g., if
``<tt>Kf</tt>'' is entered in the Class list, all applications
with names matching <tt>kf*</tt> will be selected to have
the corresponding property).


To <bf>remove</bf> (or edit and replace) an entry, 
double-click on it to select it.
(the selected item will be copied into the box for
adding new entries).
Click on the "<bf>-</bf>" button to remove it.  
You may also edit the copy in the new-entry box, 
and add it again with "<bf>+</bf>".
