<H3><A NAME="s1">1. Configuration of System Sounds.</A></H3>

<P>This screen allows ``<B>System Sounds</B>'' to be configured,
so that when one of certain <B>Events</B> (such as
opening a window, changing the desktop, etc.) occurs, a sound file
associated with that event is played.
<P>Currently, only sound files in <CODE>*.wav</CODE> format are supported by the 
KDE System Sound Module.    
<P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Activate the ``<B>enable system sounds</B>'' option to 
use the <B>System Sounds</B> feature.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<P>The <B>Sounds</B> box lists
files from the default location
<CODE>$KDEDIR/share/sounds</CODE>, where
a set of  <CODE>*.wav</CODE> files designed as  ``System Sounds''
for various events
is provided. 
<P>If other suitable
<CODE>*.wav</CODE> sound files are available to you,
they can also be added to this list 
dragging them from a File Manager (<CODE>kfm</CODE>) window onto the sound list 
box.
<P>In addition,
some of the  ``Themes'' packages install and activate
their own System Sounds.  (Themes are installed
with the Theme Manager, in the Settings->Desktop menu of the KDE
Control Center).  
<P>
<P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>To associate a sound to an event, use the pointer to
highlight its entry in the <B>Sounds</B> list.  (You may now hear the
selected sound  by
clicking on the <B>Test</B> button.)   Then highlight the
entry in the <B>Events</B> list that 
you wish to associate with it and click on <B>Apply</B> (or
<B>OK</B> if you are finished).</LI>
