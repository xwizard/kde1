<P>
<P>``<B>Cookies</B>'' are little messages you receive from a 
remote website which are intended to be stored on your
system, and  sent
back by your browser to that site the next time you visit it 
(or when you visit
another page on that site). 
<P>Cookies can be used by websites to automatically
identify you for a longer period of time. A website can use this to store
your preferences. Cookies can also be used to track your behavior
on a site. Used as such, some people consider cookies an attack on their
privacy. KFM offers you a broad range of possibilities to decide which cookies
to accept and which not to.  
<P>If ``<B>Enable Cookies</B>'' is activated,  cookies will be accepted 
according to the following settings and
stored cookies will be sent.
If it is <B>not</B> activated, no cookie will ever be sent, 
and no new cookies will be accepted.
<P>
<P>You may set specific policies for  how to treat cookies  originating
from domains listed in the ``<B>Domain specific settings</B>'' box.
<P>To add such a domain, type its name in the 
``<B>change domain accept policy</B>'' box, and select one of the
three policy choices:
<UL>
<LI> The ``<B>Accept</B>'' policy is to accept all cookies received without 
notifying the user.</LI>
<LI>  The ``<B>Ask</B>'' policy is to open a pop-up box to
ask the user what to do, each time
a cookie is received.</LI>
<LI> The ``<B>Reject</B>'' policy is to reject all cookies 
received without 
notifying the user.</LI>
</UL>

Then click on 
``<B>change</B>'' to add the new entry to the list of domain-specific
settings.    To modify the entry for an exiting domain in the list,
click on it to highlight it, then set a new cookie acceptance policy for it, 
or click on ``<B>delete</B>'' to remove it.
<P>
<P>The ``<B>default accept policy</B>'' setting
sets the acceptance policy for cookies originating from
a domain not listed in the
<B>domain-specific setting</B> box.
