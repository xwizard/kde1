<sect>Configuring the bell
<p>
The system bell or <em>beep</em> is a feature of the X server,
which attempts to make good use of the available hardware. However,
it isn't always possible for the X server to actually make a beep
sound with exactly the parameters selected due to hardware
limitations. For example, on most PCs, volume control is not very
good so the X server seems to <em>fake</em> low volume with a
reduced duration of the sound. Thus, if the settings don't seem 
to do anything, this is because the X server and/or the hardware
don't support anything better.

<p>
User's are able to set the following parameters for the bell:

<itemize>
<item>volume (percentage of "maximum" volume)
<item>pitch (in Hz)
<item>duration (in milliseconds)
</itemize>

<p>
You can use the <tt/test/ button to hear how the current settings will
sound.
