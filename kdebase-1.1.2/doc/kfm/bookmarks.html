<h2>Bookmarks</h2>

<p>KFM enlarges the meaning of bookmarks. Bookmarks can refer to every file,
that means apart from HTML pages and FTP directories documents, applications
and <tt>*.kdelnk</tt> files. If a bookmark is selected in KFM, the convenient
action follows; a document is opened, an application is started etc. To add a
file to the collection of bookmarks, you only have to use the right mouse
button on the file and select the entry &quot;Add Bookmark&quot;.</p>

<h2>Editing Bookmarks</h2>

<p>Each bookmark corresponds to a file in $HOME/.kde/share/apps/kfm/bookmarks.
An entry in the bookmarks menu makes it easy to find this directory. Renaming a
bookmark file also changes the bookmark menu immediately. If you open the
properties for such a file, you can configure the bookmark, i.e. for example
change the destination (URL) or the icon. You can move, copy and rename files in
this directory tree as you desire. Please make sure that these files have a
suffix <tt>*.kdelnk</tt>, so that KFM will easily distinguish them from
&quot;normal&quot; files.</p>

<h2>Bookmark Tree</h2>

<p>Creating a new directory in $HOME/.kde/share/apps/kfm/bookmarks will create
a submenu of the bookmark menu at the same time. To add a bookmark to the new
submenu, pop it up. The first entry will add a bookmark for the current
URL.</p>

<h2>Bookmarks outside KFM</h2>

<p>The program krootwm allows the access on the bookmarks. Clicking the right
mouse botton on the background of the desktop makes (besides other stuff) the
bookmark menu appear. Changings on the bookmarks are not immediately applied
to krootwm yet. At the moment you have to restart krootwm to do so.</p>
